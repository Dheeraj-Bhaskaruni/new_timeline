         <p>Very quiet. A sense of the vastness, the emptiness, of
            England.<a href="#note-4" target="FN" title="link to note"><img src="diamond-icon.png" alt="link to note"></a></p>

         <p>A single stagecoach, a dot in the distance, coming closer at a
            steady pace, along an empty track.</p>

         <p>Inside we see a young man with a keen, intelligent face.
            LYDGATE. And start to hear the metallic bangs and the
            clatter and the gruff shouts of the GANG DRIVERS ...</p>

         <p>And now suddenly we see what it is: GANGS OF

         <p>But the first thing we see is DOROTHEA's face, rapt,
            intent, glowing, in a kind of quiet ecstasy as she canters
            along. Her lips are parted. We can hear her breathing.
            We are going to hear and see enough of her spirituality
            later on, for now let's see a beautiful and passionate
            young woman.<a href="#note-14" target="FN" title="link to note"><img src="diamond-icon.png" alt="link to note"></a></p>

         <p>Then we see CELIA, a less accomplished horsewoman
            than her sister, a sweet pussycat face with more humour,
            more awareness of the world around her than her elder
            sister.</p>

         <p>A GROOM follows. He's bored stiff.</p>

         <p>Perhaps because she becomes aware of this, DOROTHEA

         <br>Yes - yes, I know, but is that all we can
         do: exercise horses and give employment to
         servants?</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>She's full of energy and earnestness, CELIA's much more
            placid and docile, but not without her own point of view.</p>

         <p>We might be getting PIMBLE, the Groom's perspective
            on this as the girls walk away from him across the yard.

         <p>CELIA likes being touched, and she likes dressing up,
            and she likes to feel beautiful. Nice lamplight on her
            shoulders, her skin glows, her eyes sparkle. She puts her
            hand up to her throat and touches the necklace. She's
            rather falling in love with herself. And why not?<a href="#note-29" target="FN" title="link to note"><img src="diamond-icon.png" alt="link to note"></a></p>

            tragic that she should be thwarted by her sister's scruples.</p>

         <p>And now DOROTHEA, almost drawn against her will, is
            reaching into the jewel case, lifting chains and brooches,
            letting them trickle through her fingers, as it were, and
            she sighs. Without being fully conscious of it, she is in
            fact more acutely sensual than her sister.<a href="#note-31" target="FN" title="link to note"><img src="diamond-icon.png" alt="link to note"></a>

         <p>We see CHETTAM, a handsome freshfaced young
            gentleman, and MR. BROOKE, a man of "acquiescent
            temper, miscellaneous opinions, and uncertain vote". He
            looks as if he's always managed to do quite well for
            himself.</p>

         <p>The REVEREND EDWARD CASAUBON is in his late
            forties but looks older. Gaunt. Brooding. But it's
            important that in this first meeting we should be able to
            see what DOROTHEA sees in him. A man lit by inner
            fires, with a formidable intellect and a great soul.<a href="#note-36" target="FN" title="link to note"><img src="diamond-icon.png" alt="link to note"></a></p>

         <p>He eats rather sparingly. BROOKE and CHETTAM have

         <br>Yes, very much indeed, Sir James - I wish
         you could persuade my uncle to do the
         same!</blockquote>

      <blockquote><u>BROOKE</u>
         <br>No, no, no, it won't do, it won't do. Fancy
         farming I call it, the most expensive sort of
         whistle you can buy. You may as well keep
         a pack of hounds.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>
          [with some energy]
         <br>Surely it's not a sin, Uncle, to spend
         money in finding out how we can make the
         most of the land that supports us all?</blockquote>

            DOROTHEA and her mortification at her uncle's
            dismissive words, as BROOKE goes on:</p>
      </div>

      <blockquote><u>CASAUBON</u> [shakes his head]

         literature. I live too much with the dead,
         perhaps.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He's addressing DOROTHEA now, sensing that she is the
            one most interested in what he has to say and best able to
            understand him. There's even a glimmer of a smile in his
            eyes and the corners of his mouth.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>BROOKE</u>

      <div>
         <p>Important that at this stage we should feel that it is indeed
            a great endeavour, and that this intense, dedicated scholar
            might be the man to pull it off. His tone as he speaks of
            it is rapt, and almost hypnotic, and DOROTHEA certainly
            is under his spell.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>
         <br>On the contrary - I - to me that seems a

         <br>You are very kind, Miss Brooke. I feel
         much encouraged.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>She's just looking for some great man to devote herself
            to, body and soul, and here he is. And he's deigned to
            notice her! And he's not quite so inward looking that he
            can't feel definitely chuffed that this lovely intelligent
            young woman seems keen to fling herself at his feet. And
            that is what she is signalling quite clearly with her
            great dark eyes.</p>


         <p>In this next bit, the strange rapport between DOROTHEA
            and CASAUBON is what's important: BROOKE is an
            irritating, embarrassing distraction:</p>

      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>
         <br>I wish you would let me sort your papers
         for you Uncle. I would letter them all and
         then make a list of subjects under each
         letter.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>CASAUBON</u>
         <br>You have an excellent secretary at hand,
         you perceive.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>BROOKE</u>
         <br>Oh, I can't let young ladies meddle with

         <br>It is true, Sir James.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>CHETTAM</u>
         <br>Oh, but why? You're such an
         accomplished horsewoman and it is such
         healthy exercise - and every lady should be
         a good horsewoman, you know, that she
         may accompany her husband.</blockquote>

         be a perfect horsewoman, and so I should
         never correspond to your pattern of a lady.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>CHETTAM</u>
          [ rather ponderously flirting
         again]

         <p>Her first two replies are quite lightly spoken - they're
            very like a Jane Austen heroine sticking up for herself ­
            but it would be nice if the last reply shows a little
            hesitancy and confusion, delicacy about not wanting to
            sound priggish, leaving her feeling a bit embarrassed and
            exposed.</p>

         <br>Some might not say so. Not everyone has

         <p>BULSTRODE, who has been standing waiting for
            LYDGATE, nods very coldly to FAREBROTHER.</p>

         <p>BULSTRODE is in strong contrast to both
            FAREBROTHER and LYDGATE. He looks pale,
            bloodless. But his voice and manner - his voice is a near­
            whisper - have a curious authority and presence.</p>

         <p>LYDGATE and BULSTRODE in BULSTRODE's private
            office, looking at the plans for the hospital.</p>

         <p>We see the general office of the bank through a glass
            partition (if this is consonant with interior design of the
            period). The Bank is one of the few Middlemarch
            buildings that might well be new.</p>

         <p>LYDGATE is really excited by the architect's drawings,
            and he can alternate between enthusing to BULSTRODE
            face to face, and darting back to look at more details.<a href="#note-50" target="FN" title="link to note"><img src="diamond-icon.png" alt="link to note"></a></p>

      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>This is an excellent design, Mr. Bulstrode.
         The architect has vision, and has been well
         instructed.
          [he looks inspired]
         <br>You know in a few years we could have a
         first class medical school here in
         Middlemarch - why should London and
         Paris and Edinburgh have it all? I am
         convinced that the causes and treatment of
         typhoid and cholera will very soon yield to
         rigorous scientific investigation - and why
         should they not yield to it here, in
         Middlemarch? Now where are the

         <br>I have my general practice, Mr. Bulstrode,
         and my wants are modest. I know I can do
         good here. My aim is to do good small work

      <blockquote><u>BULSTRODE</u>
         <br>He is a man deeply painful to contemplate.

      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>

      <div>
         <p>It's clearly a point of great moment for BULSTRODE.
            LYDGATE feels awkward. He likes Farebrother, feels
            he'd like to oppose BULSTRODE, but recognises that he

      <blockquote><u>BULSTRODE</u> [more softly but insistently]

         will be referred to the medical board. It
         will be voted on. You will be required to
         vote. It may be of little moment to you,
         but the issue is of vital importance to me. I
         trust that I may ask of you this at least - in
         virtue of the cooperation between us that I
         now look forward to - that you will not be
         influenced by my opponents in this matter.<a href="#note-53" target="FN" title="link to note"><img src="diamond-icon.png" alt="link to note"></a></blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>LYDGATE looks at him, rather startled.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>BULSTRODE</u>
         <br>Let me boldly confess to you, Dr.

         in conflict with my spiritual duty. I hope I
         make myself clear?</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>It's a threat, if uttered obliquely, and LYDGATE doesn't

         <p>DOROTHEA is standing by the fire and BROOKE plonks

      <blockquote><u>BROOKE</u>
         <br>I came back by Lowick, you know. I
         talked with Casaubon and saw his library,
         and that kind of thing. Won't you sit
         down, my dear?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u> [smiling]
         <br>I am quite happy to stand, Uncle.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>BROOKE</u>
         <br>Yes, well, of course. If you wish. Good.
         Ah ... Casaubon, now. I've been talking
         with Casaubon about this and that, you
         know. He seems to have greatly enjoyed
         his visits to the Grange these last few
         weeks. Yes. Yes.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>
         <br>Yes, Uncle?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>BROOKE</u>
         <br>And well, he seems to have a high opinion
         of you my dear. A very high opinion. The fact

      <blockquote><u>BROOKE</u>
         <br>The fact is, he has asked my permission to

         are very young, and so on ... I felt bound
         to tell him there was not much chance, you
         know. But there we are, I had to promise
         the poor fellow I would speak with you, so

            to reply composedly (perhaps there might be a tiny
            tremble?)</p>

      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>
         <br>Thank you, Uncle. I am very grateful to
         Mr. Casaubon. If he makes me an offer, I
         shall accept him.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>BROOKE</u>
         <br>Ah! Well!</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He is really taken aback. Then he thinks: she's being
            prudent, and she thinks this is the best offer she'll get.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>BROOKE</u>
         <br>Well, yes. He is a good match in some
         respects. But Chettam, now, have you not
         thought of him? He is a very good match.
         Our land lies together, and
         <br> [in almost a confidential manner] <br>
         I believe my dear that Chettam too wishes
         to marry you. I mention it, you know.
         There!</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He really thinks he's giving her a nice surprise, and that
            she'll say oh, sod old Casaubon then if it's game on for
            Sir James! But in fact she's listened with impatience and
            distress, dying to butt in, so that when she does reply she
            bursts out:</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>
         <br>It is impossible that I should ever marry Sir
         James Chettam. If he thinks of marrying
         me, he has made a great mistake.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>BROOKE</u> [gobsmacked]
         <br>Well, there you are. One never knows. I
         should have thought Chettam was just the
         sort of man a woman would like, now.</blockquote>

         <br>Oh. Well. But Casaubon, now. He's a
         good match in some ways ... a clever man,
         a scholar. I never got anything out of him
         - any ideas, you know. However he is a
         tip-top man and may be bishop. But you
         know he's over five and forty, and his
         health's not strong. Marriage can be a
         noose, my dear. And you are fond of your
         opinions, but a husband likes to be master,
         you know. I only mention these things to
         you, I mention them, you know.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He is trying very hard to be a wise councellor, and it is all
            said with great affection. She appreciates that and
            softens, wanting to reassure him:</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>
         <br>Uncle, I don't want a husband very near
         my own age. He should be above me in
         judgment and experience, and
         knowledge ... and I know I must expect
         trials. I never thought of marriage as mere
         personal ease. Uncle, I admire and honour
         Mr. Casaubon more than any man I ever
         saw.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>BROOKE</u> [she's convinced him]
         <br>Well, my dear, um, that being so, the fact

         borrowing on the prospect of his
         inheritance, and Featherstone will have it
         that you must write him a letter saying it's
         not so, or he'll cut Fred out altogether. I

         <br>You must understand, Vincy, that I stretch

         your son Frederick, it was entirely from
         worldly vanity that you destined him for the
         Church and sent him to the University.
         Now you are reaping the consequences of
         your own folly and his.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>VINCY</u>
         <br>Well, as to that, there's no going back. It's

         won't put a stop to this rumour about Fred
         you might as well slander him yourself.
         You know as well as I do that he hasn't
         been raising money on his expectations
         from Featherstone or anyone else. I consider

         you were able to copy out the Greek

         <p>They are heading for a big old yew-tree, and there, on
            a seat, is a young man with long brown curly hair,
            sketching it. A bit of a hippy, a bit of a Romantic

         the eyes.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>CASAUBON</u>
         <br>The answer to your question, sir, is
         painfully doubtful. I fear my young
         cousin is many things, but nothing in
         particular. To put it most generously, he
         has not yet found his vocation. His
         present purpose is to travel in Italy - to
         what end I do not know. Culture, he
         says. Well, I have agreed to support him
         for a year there: he asks no more. I shall
         let him be tried by the test of freedom.</blockquote>

         Yes. Between ourselves, the mayor's
         daughter, young Rosamond Vincy is

         the betrothal of my dear niece Dorothea
         and to my good and learned friend the
         Reverend Edward Casaubon, and to
         share in their happiness. Marriage, you
         know, is a joining, a union, a sort of
         closing up, you see, but in another sense
         it is a reaching out, a kind of
         exploration, if you like, just as
         friendship you know, that's another,
         David and Jonathan and so forth.
         Progress, now. That is going to happen
         whether we like it or not and that is why
         I am for it. Reform. In a general sense
         of course and all in moderation<a href="#note-178" target="FN" title="link to note"><img src="diamond-icon.png" alt="link to note"></a>. That's
         why I'm happy to welcome progressive
         men here, men who have the well-being
         of their fellow-men at heart, and
         women, too, of course<a href="#note-179" target="FN" title="link to note"><img src="diamond-icon.png" alt="link to note"></a>. Mr. Bulstrode
         here, of the bank, a pleasure to welcome
         you to my table, sir, and Mayor Vincy,
         excellent. Yes. - And Doctor Lydgate,
         studied in Paris and so forth, all the new
         ideas for the new hospital as is only
         right and proper, you are very welcome
         here, sir. Progress, you see, progress
         and reform. Let it never be said that
         Brooke was not for progress and reform
         - in a spirit of temperance and
         moderation of course. Yes.</blockquote>

         since their poor parents died, as much

         just see a trace of anxiety in CASAUBON's eyes.
         He's mostly thought of the relationship the other way
         around.</p>


      <blockquote><u>BROOKE</u>
         <br>And I hear that you propose to extend
         your wedding journey next month as far
         as Rome.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>CASAUBON</u>
         <br>I think the weather will be mild enough.
         There are some manuscripts in the Vatican
         that will be particularly valuable for my
         research ... unless my bride should find so
         long a journey tiring or tedious.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>
         <br>I should find nothing tiring or tedious
         that gave you pleasure, Edward. And I
         have longed to see the famous paintings and
         sculptures in Rome.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>CELIA</u>
         <br>And "Edward" will be able to tell you
         about every single one, I'm sure.<a href="#note-182" target="FN" title="link to note"><img src="diamond-icon.png" alt="link to note"></a></blockquote>


      <p>Would she call him Edward? She's not being
         horrible, she's amusing herself, as she often does.</p>


      <blockquote><u>CELIA</u>
         <br>This is a chilly wind.</blockquote>

      <blockquote><u>CASAUBON</u>
         <br>I still regret that your sister is not to
         accompany us. You will have many
         lonely hours, Dorothea - I shall feel
         constrained to make the utmost use of
         my time during our stay in Rome, and I
         should feel more at liberty if you had a
         companion.<a href="#note-183" target="FN" title="link to note"><img src="diamond-icon.png" alt="link to note"></a></blockquote>

      <blockquote><u>CASAUBON</u> [not noticing]
         <br>Yes: if you had a lady as your
         companion, I could put you both under
         the care of a cicerone...</blockquote>


      <p><br> [Rather nice if he pronounced it laboriously in a poor
         Italian accent - though I expect people anglicised
         words like that. Concise Oxford gives both as correct
         now).] <br></p>


      <blockquote><u>CASAUBON</u>
         <br>... and we could thus achieve two
         purposes in the same space of time.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He might be getting into the carriage by now.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>
         <br>You must have misunderstood me very
         much Edward if you think I should not
         value your time! I beg you will not referto
         this again.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He turns, perhaps caught in some ungainly carriage
            mounting pose. He doesn't know what he's done to
            upset her. He thought he was thinking of her needs,
            as Brooke hinted he should. Now what's the matter
            with her? He feels scared and upset himself.</p>

         <p>She sees it, and is flooded with tenderness. Puts her
            hand on his.</p>

      <div>
         <p>And off he goes, and DOROTHEA watches him
            dwindle down the long drive with something less than
            unadulterated bliss.</p>

         Middlemarch as it comes; you have
         nothing to fear. I have certainly found

            lovely in her simple white nightdress.</p>

         <p>She blows out the candle and goes through into the
            bedroom.</p>

         <p>There's a fire on and CASAUBON is sitting in a chair
            sort of crouching over it.</p>

         <p>As she comes in, he turns, and his face seems full of
            dread.<a href="#note-226" target="FN" title="link to note"><img src="diamond-icon.png" alt="link to note"></a></p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>
         <br>Edward?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>CASAUBON</u>
         <br>I am very tired.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>A little attempt at his wintry smile. She's too much for
            him. He fears her youth, her energy, her intelligence,
            and her sexuality.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u> [softly]
         <br>What is it, my love? You know I would do
         anything to make you happy.</blockquote>

      <blockquote><u>CASAUBON</u> [he's so tight and stressed]
         <br>I am perfectly happy, my dear. I am
         simply very tired. That is all.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u> [miserably]
         <br>Yes. Yes. Yes, of course.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>It's as if they're both stuck now, in this awkward pose,
            unable to comfort each other, like a subject for Picasso's
            Blue Period.</p>

      <div>
         <p>CASAUBON in bed, sleeping like a corpse.</p>

         <p>DOROTHEA awake, lying by him. She would love to
            comfort him; she would like him to love and comfort her.</p>

         <p>She touches him tentatively. Even in his sleep, he turns
            away from her.</p>

         <p>She slips out of bed and goes to the window.</p>

         <p>She turns and looks back at CASAUBON. The notebooks
            on the table. She opens one of them.</p>

         <p>Even in the moonlight we can see the crossings out, the
            overwritings. Chaos.</p>

         <p>Somewhere not far off a deep bell starts to toll.<a href="#note-228" target="FN" title="link to note"><img src="diamond-icon.png" alt="link to note"></a></p>

      <div>
         <p>Morning. Remains of a breakfast.</p>

         <p>DOROTHEA sits opposite CASAUBON looking at him.</p>

         <p>He's rifling through one of his leather-bound notebooks,
            making little grunts. A thought strikes him - he needs to
            consult another notebook.</p>

         <p>He gets up. We see the whole row of them, about
            twenty.</p>

         <p>He takes another one back to the table and bends over it.
            He's in a world of his own, excluding her.</p>

         <p>She's starting to get the first inklings that the whole thing
            might have been a terrible mistake.</p>

      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>

         today, Edward?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>CASAUBON</u>
         <br>What? Yes, yes ...</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He thinks of something else. Riffling through the
            notebooks.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u> [hesitant]
         <br>I hope you're thoroughly satisfied with
         our stay - I mean, so far as your studies
         are concerned.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>CASAUBON</u> [still not looking up]
         <br>Yes ...</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>(That "with that peculiar pitch of voice which makes
            the word half a negative"). Now I think he does look
            up, but probably not at her.</p>

      <blockquote><u>CASAUBON</u>

      <div>
         <p>He's in an awful tangled almost dream-world of half­

         <p>Now he does give her his attention, even tries to be
            nice.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>CASAUBON</u>
         <br>The task has been a somewhat laborious
         one, but your society has happily
         prevented me from that too continuous
         mental labour which has been the snare
         of my solitary life.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He even manages one of his smiles. But he's already
            burrowing back into his notebooks.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>
         <br>I am very glad that my presence has
         made any difference to you. I hope
         when we get back to Lowick I shall be
         more useful.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>CASAUBON</u> [absently]
         <br>Doubtless, my dear.</blockquote>

      <blockquote><u>CASAUBON</u>

      <div>
         <p>We should begin to sense that he has lost his way:
            he's almost frightened that he's been led further than
            he can cope with - he's taking comfort from his petty
            feud with Carp, and talking to himself because he's
            frightened of Dorothea.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>
         <br>Shall the world know it soon, Edward?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>CASAUBON</u>
         <br>What?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>
         <br>All your notes - all these rows of volumes ­
         surely it's time now to do what you used to
         speak of: to write your book and make
         your great knowledge useful to the world!
         I will do anything - write to your dictation,
         or copy and extract what you tell me - but
         surely, Edward it is time now to expose
         your great theory to the judgment of your
         fellow scholars! How eagerly they must
         be awaiting it! And I am eager, too, to
         help you, and to share in your
         labours ... Edward?</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>Important that there's no hint of sarcasm - she is impatient
            for him to get on with it and doesn't realise how
            threatening her enthusiasm is to him.</p>

         <p>She can't understand why he looks so hunted and angry;
            why he turns on her like a cornered animal. It's not so
            much what he says, it's the way he says it:</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>CASAUBON<a href="#note-230" target="FN" title="link to note"><img src="diamond-icon.png" alt="link to note"></a></u>
         <br>My love: you may rely upon me to know
         the times and the seasons adapted to the
         different stages of a work which is not to
         be measured by the ... facile conjectures of
         ignorant onlookers.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He's telling her she's shallow, ignorant, a jeering
            spectator of his lonely endeavours. And underneath he's
            screaming to be left alone.</p>

         <p>DOROTHEA is hurt and indignant:</p>
      </div>


      <hr>
      <p class="centered">[Page]

      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA<a href="#note-231" target="FN" title="link to note"><img src="diamond-icon.png" alt="link to note"></a></u>
         <br>My judgment was a superficial one, but
         what else could it be?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>CASAUBON</u>
         <br>What else indeed? It is ever the trial of
         the scrupulous explorer to be saluted
         with the impatient scorn of chatterers.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>What a mean-minded thing to say. He probably can't
            bring himself to look at her as he says it.</p>

         <p>DOROTHEA is hurt, but she's angry too, indignant,
            feels herself in the right, strong in her conviction of
            rightness. She speaks with such force that he might
            wince away from her:</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>
         <br>How can you think that of me? How have
         I offended you? You have shown me these
         rows of notebooks. You have often spoken
         of them. You have often said that they
         wanted digesting. But I have never heard
         you speak of the writing that is to be
         published. Those are very simple facts.
         My judgment went no further. I only
         begged you to let me be some good to you!</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>She gets up and moves away from the table and stares out
            of the window seeing nothing, very near crying, but
            still surging, the adrenalin pulsing through her body.</p>

         <p>CASAUBON picks up a letter and pretends to re-read it.
            His hands are shaking.</p>

         <p>Somewhere a bell is bonging.<a href="#note-232" target="FN" title="link to note"><img src="diamond-icon.png" alt="link to note"></a></p>

         <p>VINCY was about to invite LADY MEDLICOTE to
            unveil the engraved foundation stone, BROOKE has sort
            of blundered into the way and now backs off into TWO
            OTHER PEOPLE.</p>

         <p>MEDLICOTE glares. BULSTRODE looks furious.

         <p>LADY MEDLICOTE makes her gracious way, pulls the

         <p>LYDGATE turns. BULSTRODE is exercising his power.
            LYDGATE doesn't like it much, but duty calls.</p>

      <blockquote><u>LADISLAW</u>
         <br>On the contrary. I've quite made up my
         mind against it. I have no genius for
         painting, and I should never succeed in
         anything by dint of drudgery. If things

         Streichmann, Unterbecker, Kott ... If Mr.
         Casaubon read German he could have
         saved himself a deal of trouble.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>LADISLAW just meant to put CASAUBON down in a
            casual sort of way: now he is taken aback by
            DOROTHEA's stricken response.</p>

         <p>Being a bit of a hippy he doesn't understand how

      <div>
         <p>NAUMANN is a successful painter. It's a big studio with
            a tall window with the coveted north light.</p>

         <p>He is working on more than one unfinished painting, and
            finished ones are hanging all over the place. Large scale
            stuff ... a bit like Delacroix or Gericault I'd guess,
            Romantic, symbolic, full of heroic figures.</p>

         <p>DOROTHEA is spellbound. CASAUBON looks a bit
            cold and forbidding as he always does when he's unsure
            of himself, but NAUMANN has been well coached:</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>NAUMANN</u>
         <br>Mr. Casaubon, you do me great honour. I
         have long admired your formidable
         scholastic powers. Indeed I think I may
         say that all Europe awaits your great work
         on mythology in fear and trembling. I am
         proud to welcome you - and Mrs.
         Casaubon, of course.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He does it just right, including DOROTHEA almost as an
            afterthought. CASAUBON's froideur melts, and DOROTHEA is
            delighted for him. She also suspects nothing.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>CASAUBON</u>
         <br>You are very kind, sir.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>NAUMANN</u>
         <br>Oh, no, sir, it is you - my young friend
         Ladislaw thinks you will pardon me if I say
         that a sketch of your head would be
         invaluable to me for St. Thomas Aquinas in
         the canvas there? Perhaps it is too much to
         ask? - but we so seldom see just what we
         need - the idealistic in the actual, in this
         case.</blockquote>

         should be honoured ... that is to say if the
         operation will not be a lengthy one - and if
         Mrs. Casaubon will not object to the delay?</blockquote>

         poor Fred worse instead of better. You

         <p>BULSTRODE takes his place in the chair in his usual

         <p>LYDGATE is trying to give people friendly looks, but is

         <p>CASAUBON's carriage rattles along the drive towards the

            tells us that all is not well, that at the best life is a matter
            of stoical endurance.</p>

         <p>We can see the cases and trunks from the Rome journey
            piled on the top.</p>

         <p>Inside the carriage: CASAUBON with a face like stone,
            gaunt, gloomy, and miserable. DOROTHEA looks
            exhausted and dispirited too. Such a contrast with the

         <p>But when they come round the bend that brings us in sight

            at her and listening to her and flirting with her: she

         <p>A small party going on.
            MR. VINCY is playing cards with FAREBROTHER,
            HAWLEY and CHICHELY.</p>

         <p>ROSAMOND is in a tete a tete with NED PLYMDALE,
            one of the good matches in Middlemarch, though not one of
            its leading minds.</p>

         <p>MRS. PLYMDALE, NED's mother, sits chatting with
            MRS. BULSTRODE. Two or three YOUNG PEOPLE
            are gathered round the piano that one of them is tinkling
            about on ...</p>

         <p>We move in on NED and ROSAMOND. They are
            looking at the "Keepsake", which has pictures of famous
            society beauties in it.</p>

      <div>
         <p>NED has a Coventry accent of the genteeler sort:
            Styvechale rather than Bell Green, say. His family are on
            the up-and-up financially while the Vincy fortunes are
            declining. But he feels much less secure socially than
            Rosamond or Fred.</p>

         <br>Do you think so? Her back is very large, I
         should have thought.</blockquote>

         <br>Ah! But I didn't say she was as beautiful
         as you are!</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He's very pleased with this remark, it's about as clever as

         <p>She's just playing with him. To her he's the epitome of
            Middlemarch mediocrity. And just as she says this,
            LYDGATE comes in and she immediately gives him all
            her attention, laying the "Keepsake" aside, as he comes
            towards her smiling confidently.</p>

         guardian angel during Fred's illness.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>LYDGATE, as she says this, picks up the "Keepsake" and
            gives a short scornful laugh, and half under his breath
            says:</p>

      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>Good God.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>ROSAMOND</u>
         <br>And what are you laughing at so profanely?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>I don't know which is the sillier, this

         accompanies it - it's really splendidly

      <div>
         <p>She's delighted that LYDGATE has seen him off - and
            she puts her hand on his arm as she speaks. She is
            making them into an intimate couple with a private
            understanding that excludes outsiders.</p>

      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>

         sorry. I didn't think about it.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>ROSAMOND</u>
         <br>You are like a bear - I don't think you
         know your own strength, or your power to
         hurt. Do you remember, when you first

         you wanted teaching by the birds.</blockquote>

            maidens perhaps) and see NED PLYMDALE staring balefully over,
            the LADIES tut tutting, FAREBROTHER's sharp eyes taking

      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u> [smiles]
         <br>Oh, I'm in no danger there. I assure you.
         Rosamond Vincy is an enchanting girl.
         Sweet, docile, and everything about her full
         of grace and fragrance. If I were thinking
         of marriage I believe I'd snap her up this
         instant! But I'm not. Not for a long while
         - I mean to establish myself properly before

         <br>Hmm. In my experience, when a man's

         <p>LYDGATE puts his stethoscope away. Turns and looks

      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>You should not distress yourself unduly.
         He is breathing very comfortably now. He
         should sleep for some hours.</blockquote>

      </div>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>I'm afraid it's very difficult to say in these
         cases. It is essential now that he should not
         strain his nervous powers in any way. In
         particular, I would advise you not to tell
         him of the seriousness of his condition:
         increased anxiety can exacerbate disease of
         the heart.</blockquote>

         did not know which might make me act

         <br>I shall speak absolutely plainly. He may
         have another attack within days, or weeks.
         On the other hand, he may live for five,
         ten, or even fifteen years.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>
         <br>You mean, if we are very careful.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>It's a desperate thought: she turns to LYDGATE and
            opens her heart to him.</p>

         his work. He has been labouring all his
         life and looking forward. He minds about
         nothing else. And I mind almost nothing else.
         Help me, pray. Tell me what I can do.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>It's very intimate, this, but not sexy. We might feel
            that these two would be right for each other - it doesn't for a
            moment occur to either of them.</p>

         <p>After a pause, during which LYDGATE thinks what a
            fine woman she is, and how sorry he is for her, and then
            what the hell could he say to help her:</p>
      </div>

         <br>What about foreign travel? You have been
         lately in Rome, I think.</blockquote>

         <br>Oh, no, no, that would be worse than anything.</blockquote>

         <p>MARY feels sorry for him, but she won't give way. She
            goes back to her chair.</p>

         <p>He is glaring at her.</p>

         <p>She closes her eyes.</p>

         <br>Dear me, what a wonderfully mixed set of
         people! Who can they all be? Mr. Lydgate
         as doctor, I suppose ... but that is really a

         <p>MRS. VINCY tends to bridle back at them a bit.</p>

         <p>TRUMBULL is there, eyeing up MARY GARTH.

         <br>The will I hold here in my hand was drawn
         up by myself on the ninth of August 1825.

         in the parish of Lowick to Joshua Rigg,
         under the same conditions. The remainder
         of the estate is to be devoted to the erection
         and endowment of almshouses for old men,
         to be called Featherstone's Almshouses.
         There are no other bequests whatsoever,
         except that Mr. Borthrop Trumbull is to
         have the gold-headed cane.</blockquote>

         <p>The waves of shock are running through the gathering
            before STANDISH is finished, at the mention of the
            almshouses.</p>

         <p>On "no other bequests whatsoever" see FRED's stunned
            expression, all his hopes dashed. Music crashing doomy
            chords over the next few speeches, which are more or less
            simultaneous, as the gathering erupts, and I think we stay
            with poor FRED in the middle of the picture.</p>

         <br>Not all my days. Not all the hours in any
         day. And I am happy to be here.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>LADISLAW</u>
         <br>You look so much paler than you did in
         Rome. Couldn't you get your hushand a
         secretary? - then you could walk, and
         ride, and get your colour back, and only
         help him in lighter ways.</blockquote>

         <br>How can you think of that? I should have
         no happiness if I didn't help him in his

         <br>I should not have thought that post would
         have suited you.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>LADISLAW</u>
         <br>It did not suit Mr. Casaubon. I don't think
         he likes anyone to overlook his work and what
         he is trying to do. He is too doubtful - too
         uncertain of himself. I made the mistake of
         offering him my opinions. I am afraid he
         dislikes me because I too often ventured to
         disagree with him.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u> [who wants to think well of them both]
         <br>And yet he overcame his dislike of you as
         far as his actions were concerned.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>LADISLAW</u>
         <br>Yes, he has shown a sense of justice in
         family matters. It was an abominable thing
         that my Grandmother should have been
         disinherited.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>
         <br>I wonder how she bore the change from
         wealth to poverty. Do you know much
         about her?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>LADISLAW</u>
         <br>She married for love. That's all. There is
         nothing to be said against my grandfather
         except that he was a Polish patriot who was
         forced to flee his homeland, and obliged to
         give music lessons for his living. For this
         alone she was disinherited. My mother ran
         away from her family too, to get her own
         living - went on the stage, in fact. You see
         I come from rebellious blood on both sides.</blockquote>

         <p>Pause.</p>

         <br>And now you are settled here again?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>LADISLAW</u>
         <br>For the time being. There is work for me
         to do here. And I belong to nobody
         anywhere else. But if you think I shouldn't
         stay, then I shall go.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>
         <br>Why should I think that? I should like you
         to stay very much.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>She doesn't realise he's in love with her. Not
            consciously, anyway. She doesn't realise she fancies him
            either. She's too innocent by half.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>LADISLAW</u>
         <br>Then I will stay.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He rises, on impulse, looks out of the window, as if by
            her consent she has given him permission to conquer the
            world, and he can't wait to get on with it.</p>

         <p>She suddenly feels anxious.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>
         <br>But - perhaps you should be guided by Mr.
         Casaubon. I spoke without thinking of
         anything but my own feelings. Can't you
         wait now and mention it to him?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>LADISLAW</u>
         <br>I can't wait today. The rain's over now
         and your uncle is expecting me. And I feel
         the need to use my body - a five mile walk
         to Tipton with the sun gleaming on the wet
         grass is just what I require!</blockquote>

         <p>She smiles again. She would never allow herself to think
            how his youth and virility contrasts with Casaubon, but
            that is what she is responding to.</p>

         <p>He comes towards her. There's a lot of going on beneath

         <br>Yes - he was hoping to see you. Now that
         he is independent of your financial support
         he is seeking some fixed occupation. He

         <br>There, Dodo! Is he not quite the most
         perfect little creature you ever saw?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>
         <br>Indeed he is. Probably the most perfect
         baby that ever lived.</blockquote>

         <br>Probably? Certainly he is, certainly!
         Aren't you, my sweet one?</blockquote>

         <p>DOROTHEA responds warmly and affectionately: it's
            something she would have loved for herself but she
            doesn't begrudge CELIA her happiness.</p>

      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>

         the hustings!</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>CHETTAM</u>
         <br>He brings it upon himself. He's the worst
         landlord in the county. I want him to
         take Caleb Garth on again as agent - he got
         rid of Garth twelve years ago, and everything's
         been going wrong since. I think of getting
         Garth to manage for me - he's an excellent
         man.</blockquote>

         <br>If Dorothea had kept near her uncle there
         might have been some hope for him. But

      <blockquote><u>MRS. CADWALLADER</u> [looking at DOROTHEA]
         <br>Well: if she can visit her nephew she can
         visit her uncle. Someone, at any rate, is

         sense.</blockquote>

         Freshitt and Tipton, and a bit of Lowick

         <p>LYDGATE doesn't see her. He strides in to the Yew

      <div>
         <p>LYDGATE and CASAUBON have almost reached the

         <p>Perhaps we might hear CASAUBON'S opening words as a
            voice over as we see them from a distance:</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>CASAUBON</u>
         <br>My life, Dr Lydgate, derives a possible
         importance through my work, at present
         uncompleted: a "Key to All Mythologies".
         It is, I believe, all that I will be
         remembered for, and - if I am to die soon ­
         I would wish to leave it in such a state that
         it might be committed to the press by .....
         others. You understand what I am saying?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>Yes. Yes, I do.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>CASAUBON</u>
         <br>You have not implied that my symptons
         were those of a fatal disease, but were it
         so, such knowledge would be very ....
         useful to me.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>Mr Casaubon, with diseases of the heart it is
         particularly difficult to predict with certainty
         - you may live a comfortable life for another
         fifteen years, but ... it is my duty to tell
         you that death is often sudden.<a href="#note-328" target="FN" title="link to note"><img src="diamond-icon.png" alt="link to note"></a></blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>Now we're in on CASAUBON to catch his reaction.
            Eliot says "When the commonplace 'we all must die'
            transforms itself suddenly into the acute consciousness 'I
            must die - and soon', then death grapples us, and his
            fingers are cruel".</p>

         I have to ask you: did you communicate
         what you have now told me to Mrs.
         Casaubon?</blockquote>

         <p>LADISLAW striding along, bright-eyed and bushy tailed.</p>

         <p>The square is full of PEOPLE, some going about their
            business, some gathered in knots and talking eagerly, even
            quarrelling.</p>

         <p>On one corner a wild-eyed and rather scruffy AGITATOR
            has set up a box and is haranguing a small crowd.
            Nearby a MAN is putting up pro-reform posters.<a href="#note-352" target="FN" title="link to note"><img src="diamond-icon.png" alt="link to note"></a></p>

         <p>And he strides on his way to the Pioneer office, while

         <br>Now, now, not too fast, young friend,
         Wilberforce and his negroes, all fine and
         good, Criminal Law reform, long overdue,
         but I don't want to go the whole hog with
         reform and give the vote to every Tom
         Dick and Harry, that would be changing
         the balance of the constitution do you see?</blockquote>

         <br>But we want to change the balance of the
         constitution, that's what Reform is about.<a href="#note-358" target="FN" title="link to note"><img src="diamond-icon.png" alt="link to note"></a></blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>BROOKE</u>
         <br>Yes, yes, I suppose you're right - but we
         don't want to go to extremes, you know.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>LADISLAW<a href="#note-359" target="FN" title="link to note"><img src="diamond-icon.png" alt="link to note"></a></u>
         <br>The extreme in this case is the tumbril and
         the guillotine, Mr. Brooke. So we must
         embrace reform, not nibble at bits of it.
         That's like asking for a bit of an avalanche
         which is already on its way!</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>BROOKE</u>
         <br>Aye, that's good! That's very good! That
         avalanche was first rate! You see that's the
         sort of thing I want - not ideas, you know,
         but a way of putting them. My word,
         though, you express yourself well, you'd
         be a capital Member of Parliament
         yourself, Ladislaw!</blockquote>

         <p>LADISLAW reacts sharply.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>LADISLAW</u>
         <br>Pocket borough! You forget sir that a

         <p>He's got himself quite worked up and his fierceness

         <br>No. No, we haven't. Ladislaw, I must
         leave you now. Lowick, you know: wills,
         documents, sad business ... carry on with
         the good work - that avalanche was first
         rate - bit of an avalanche, excellent,

            he is trying to physically warm her with his words ­

         <br>Mr. Farebrother, a very good day to you.

         trouble you for a moment?</blockquote>

      <blockquote><u>MAWMSEY</u>
         <br>The other day, Dr. Lydgate, when you
         were so good as to visit Mrs. Mawmsey,
         you, ah, you omitted to prescribe her
         strengthening medicine. You'll forgive me
         for mentioning your little oversight.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>It wasn't an oversight, Mr. Mawmsey. She
         doesn't need any strengthening medicine.
         She's as strong as a horse. Let her take a
         glass of wine with her dinner if you will.</blockquote>

         <br>The reason doctors prescribe so much

         only way they can make their money. If
         men like Wrench could charge for
         consultations, they woudn't need to
         overdose the king's lieges - and that's the

         <br>You're right, Farebrother. I'd be a bear if
         I grumbled. But these Middlemarchers are
         slow to take on new ideas, and they're slow
         to pay their bills; and marriage I find, is

          [he smiles fondly]

         <p>LYDGATE claps FAREBROTHER on the shoulder, and

         <p>FAREBROTHER watches him, as BULSTRODE takes
            his arm, leans confidentially towards him, and walks him
            into the entrance.</p>

         <p>LYDGATE does look as if he might be becoming
            BULSTRODE's creature, and perhaps the music thinks so

         find a better field, do you see. For your

         great temptation, to go mad, but don't go
         in for it, my dear, you wouldn't like it. I
         dare say you're bored here, with our good
         dowager, and Baby, of course, with all his
         wonderful expressions ... but think what a
         bore you'd become yourself, sitting alone
         in that dark library, playing the tragedy
         queen and taking things sublimely.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u> [not put out]
         <br>I'm afraid I shall always have a tendency to
         take things sublimely, and it's too late to
         try to cure me of it now. But you must
         not concern yourself on my account,
         Mrs. Cadwallader. I am quite determined
         to live alone at Lowick .... I have some
         ideas in my mind about how I shall live
         there, and they might not agree with some,

         <p>He puts his hat on the table. It looks silly and
            incongruous, so he picks it up again. Oh, God, it's left a
            mark on the polished surface (damp with dew). He rubs
            at the mark. Feels ridiculous. The most tragic meeting
            of his life and here he is messing about with a wet hat.</p>

         <p>A sound. He looks round.</p>

         <p>DOROTHEA comes in. She is a bit agitated now she is
            face to face with him. She has never spelt it out to
            herself, but he does make her heart go pit-a-pat.</p>

         <p>LADISLAW, now he sees her, is more decisive. After

      <blockquote><u>LADISLAW</u>
         <br>Quite soon, I think. My contract with the
         "Pioneer" has three weeks to run. I
         intend to go to London and study for the
         Bar. Everyone says that's the best route
         into public affairs. There's a great deal of
         work to do politically ... and I mean to try

      <div>
         <p>She's trying to be warm and encouraging, but there's
            something a bit tremulous about it. She's going to miss
            him terribly, and she feels that he doesn't want to go
            either.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>LADISLAW</u>
         <br>Then you approve of my going away for

         I've made my mark in the world?</blockquote>

         <br>I suppose it must be right for you to do as

         <p>He gives a minimal bow, a mere half inch from the
            vertical.</p>

         <p>LADISLAW returns it precisely.</p>

            say it, the whole thing is hopeless.</p>

         <p>He turns and walks out quickly.</p>

         <p>CHETTAM glares after him, and is still bristling with
            anger at the interloper, the bounder, the insolent gypsy.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>CHETTAM</u>
         <br>I am surprised that he should show his face
         in this house.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>
         <br>You should not be angry with Mr.
         Ladislaw, James. He has acted very
         properly and very honourably ... and he
         has known so much injustice. I wish I

         some reparation, but it seems impossible ...</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>She seems quite close to tears again, quite distressed, and
            CHETTAM's reaction has changed from rage to

         <p>MAYOR VINCY, MRS. VINCY, LYDGATE,
            ROSAMOND, CAPTAIN LYDGATE, MR.
            BULSTRODE, MRS. BULSTRODE, FAREBROTHER,
            FRED VINCY, and various Middlemarch LADIES and
            GENTS we've seen at these gatherings before.</p>

         <p>ROSAMOND is playing the piano, but this time
            CAPTAIN LYDGATE is turning the pages.</p>

         <p>LYDGATE is talking to FAREBROTHER.</p>

         <p>ROSAMOND comes to the end of her piece, and VINCY
            taps a glass with a spoon to get attention.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>VINCY</u>
         <br>Friends, neighbours ... this is not one of
         your stiff formal functions, open house has
         always been our way - but let me just say a
         word now to welcome home my son Fred
         here, and drink his health. I won't deny
         we've had our little differences in the past,
         but he has buckled down to his studies and
         passed his final examination at Oxford
         University. I've said some hard things
         about him in the past: now I'd like to say I
         have in Fred the best and best natured son a
         man could wish for! Here's to you, Fred!
         Congratulations, son.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>PEOPLE raise their glasses and drink, say
            congratulations. Everyone looks pleased, because
            everyone likes FRED.</p>

         <p>FRED looks pleased and embarrassed.</p>

         <p>The BULSTRODES approach MRS. VINCY.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>BULSTRODE</u>
         <br>You must he very gratified, sister, that
         your son has felt a calling to enter Christ's
         ministry.</blockquote>

      <p class="centered">[Page]
         4/78</p>


      <blockquote><u>MRS. VINCY</u>
         <br>Well ... yes. I mean, Walter has always
         hoped for a son in the church . And Fred
         has always been a good boy at heart. It does
         seem strange to think of him conducting
         christenings and funerals. Still, when he is
         got in the way of it, I daresay it'll become
         like second nature, don't you think?</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>No, BULSTRODE doesn't think so - MRS BULSTRODE
            looks embarrassed.</p>

         <p>ROSAMOND goes off into a peal of laughter at
            something CAPTAIN LYDGATE has said.</p>

         <p>LYDGATE glances across. He doesn't look threatened,
            but he does look irritated.</p>

         <p>Now we are with ROSAMOND and CAPTAIN
            LYDGATE. FRED is, I think, in earshot.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>ROSAMOND</u>
         <br>Poor Fred - she isn't pretty, you know, but
         she's most particular - first she wouldn't
         have him because of his drinking and
         gambling, and now she won't have him
         because he's going to be a clergyman!</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>CAPTAIN LYDGATE roars with laughter.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>ROSAMOND</u>
         <br>No, that's cruel, we mustn't laugh at poor Fred!</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>Perhaps FRED turns and glares and she makes a face at
            him.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>ROSAMOND</u>
         <br>People are staring, Captain Lydgate - I
         shouldn't monopolise you. You must go
         and talk to some of the other ladies.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>CAPTAIN LYDGATE</u>
         <br>Certainly shan't. Never saw such a
         damned ugly collection of women in my
         life.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>ROSAMOND</u>

         mother. As for the rest ... well, if they
         were hounds, I'd shoot them.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>Then we go to VINCY and FAREBROTHER:</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>VINCY</u>
         <br>We were all glad to hear about the Lowick
         chaplaincy, Mr. Farebrother, now how
         much would that pay, if I'm not speaking
         out of turn?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>FAREBROTHER</u> [smiling]
         <br>Forty pounds a year, Mr. Vincy.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>VINCY</u>
         <br>Couldn't happen to a better man! Forty
         pounds! A man could get married on that!
         Any notions?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>FAREBROTHER</u>
         <br>Only one, Mr. Vincy. And I'm afraid she
         is inclined to favour a younger man.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He is looking at FRED. VINCY doesn't pick that up.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>VINCY</u>
         <br>Forty pounds a year has changed many a
         young girl's mind, don't give up hope.
         You'll be sitting down with us for a few
         hands of whist later?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>FAREBROTHER</u>
         <br>Not tonight, Vincy. If Fred can reform,
         then I can too. Good night, Lydgate!</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>Mm? Oh ... good night, Farebrother.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He turns, picks up a glass and drains it. He looks rather
            grim and preoccupied.</p>

      <blockquote><u>ROSAMOND</u>
         <br>You hardly ever speak to him.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>My dear Rosy, I feed and house the fellow,
         you mustn't expect me to talk to him as
         well. The man's an ass. If he got his head
         broken, I might look at it with interest.
         Not before.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>ROSAMOND</u>
         <br>I cannot conceive why you should speak of
         your cousin so contemptuously. In my
         opinion he is a thorough gentleman.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>The fact is, you would wish me to be a
         little more like him, Rosy.</blockquote>

         thousands, thousands and thousands, Nick,
         a hundred thousand, I was told. All ill-
         gotten gains, Nick, and none of it yours by
         rights. Oh, he's a clever fellow, old Nicky
         Bulstrode, he cheated the daughter out of
         her money and let her die destitute while he
         married the mother and got the lot! Rolling
         in it! Thousands and thousands and all I

         Give me a couple of hundred, and I'll go

         <br>Middlemarch men are slow to change. We
         have to be patient. I know you've had considerable expenses.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>Yes: purchasing the practice. And the
         house, of course. But the two outstanding
         debts at present are to yourself, for the
         silver plate and the cutlery and jewellery ...
         and to Harkins for the furniture. I must tell
         you plainly Mr. Spooner that I have not the
         wherewithal at present to pay either of you.</blockquote>

         <br>Yes, that seems about what ... yes. I'll
         take this over, Dr. Lydgate, along with
         what you owe this establishment. Which
         would make five hundred and twenty seven
         pounds altogether ... at five percent? Is
         that agreeable?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>Yes. I appreciate your understanding.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>SPOONER</u>
         <br>Young professional man, establishing
         himself. And the security is good. I'll
         draw up a document and you can come in
         and sign tomorrow. My valuer, Mr.
         Manley, and his assistant will need to visit
         the house to take an inventory.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>An inventory? I shouldn't have thought
         that would be necessary? Can't you go by
         the original bill of sale?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>SPOONER</u>
         <br>Less wear and tear, well, I suppose we
         might at a pinch, but I've found from long
         experience Dr. Lydgate that it's better to
         do these things in the proper way. It
         avoids misunderstandings. You'll find my
         men will be very tactful. Mrs. Lydgate
         will hardly know they're there, sir.</blockquote>

         any of the silver in mint condition ... at
         eighty percent of cost ... or if Mrs.
         Lydgate found that any of the wedding
         jewellery was ... superfluous to her

         <br>Of course, Dr. Lydgate. Absolutely.

         <br>Ah ... Mrs. Spooner and I were extremely
         sorry to hear of Mrs. Lydgate's little riding
         accident ... she ah, she lost a baby, I
         understand? I trust she is recovering now?</blockquote>

         <p>LYDGATE is not pleased that Rosy's riding mishap is

         expenses have exceeded our income, and I
         have been forced to borrow against the

         someone I am very fond of. I've loved her
         ever since we were children.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>FAREBROTHER loves her too, of course, though FRED
            doesn't know that. Eliot says FAREBROTHER examines
            some labels with extra care as he replies.</p>

         would have me.</blockquote>

         <br>And ... you think she returns your feeling?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>FRED</u>
         <br>She will never say so, but I do think she
         cares about me. What I wanted to ask
         you ... would you talk to her about me?
         You see if Mary says she will never have
         me, I may as well go into the Church - at
         least my father will be pleased. But if she
         does love me - then I shall be guided by
         her. I should like to learn farming, but that
         takes capital, and Father can't spare any
         more. But if only she'd give me some
         encouragement, I'd find some occupation
         that would make me worthy of her, I know
         I would.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>FAREBROTHER</u>
         <br>Why are you asking me, Fred? Surely you
         should talk to her yourself</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>FRED</u>
         <br>She made me promise not to speak about it
         again. But she might listen to what you
         say. She thinks so highly of you.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>FAREBROTHER feels that rather a lot is being asked of
            him. He's not exactly feeling bitter, but he's feeling

      </div>


      <blockquote><u>FAREBROTHER</u>
         <br>You're very confident that I shall plead
         your case with her. You must feel it to
         be a very deserving one.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>FRED</u>
         <br>It isn't that Mr. Farehrother. It's just that
         I don't know how I could live without the
         hope of her ... it would be like learning to
         live with wooden legs. Please speak to her
         for me.</blockquote>

      <blockquote><u>CHETTAM</u>
         <br>I was speaking to Standish the lawyer this
         morning about a matter of business and he
         informed me that the young adventurer
         Ladislaw is still to be seen walking about
         Middlemarch, proud as a peacock, as if he
         had every right to.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>MRS. CADWALLADER</u>
         <br>Well, I suppose he has, Sir James. I know
         it's a disgrace to be a foreigner, but
         unfortunately it is not yet a crime.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>CHETTAM</u>
         <br>Come, come, it is not a joking matter, Mrs.
         Cadwallader. I suppose the whole county
         knows by now about the terms of
         Casaubon's will. By remaining here
         he makes Dorothea a subject of gossip and
         speculation.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>MRS. CADWALLADER</u>
         <br>You are quite right. And from what I hear
         he has done very little for the reputation of
         young Mrs. Lydgate either.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>CHETTAM</u>
         <br>I have been wondering how I could broach
         the matter to Dorothea without ...

         <br>I don't mean that it's of any consequence.
         Only - only it's desirable that Dorothea
         should know there are reasons why she

         <br>Mrs. Cadwallader: you began by saying that
         one report was false - why should this one

            his sense of desperation and hopelessness, and oddly
            resentment, because she seems cold to him. We need to

            has his scruples about the will, she has her confusion

         only thing that I can do!</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>ROSAMOND</u>
         <br>I should have thought there were other
         things. Why do we not sell up and leave
         Middlemarch altogether?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>To do what? What's the use of my leaving
         my work in Middlemarch to go where I
         have none? We should be just as penniless
         elsewhere as we are here!</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He is very angry with her, not just because she refuses to
            (or is unable to) understand, but because she is
            demonstrating some kind of superiority, almost contempt.
            She's being the calm one, the blameless one; he's the
            helpless ranter. He'd like to take her by her pretty throat
            and shake her. And there's worse to come:</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>ROSAMOND</u>
         <br>If we are to be penniless, it will be your
         fault, Tertius. Why couldn't you show
         more respect to your family? Sir Godwin
         was very kind to me when we were in
         Quallingham, and I am sure that if you
         showed a proper regard for him, he would
         do anything for you. But instead you like
         giving up our house and furniture to Mr.
         Ned Plymdale.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>That galls her, because of course she turned down Ned
            herself for LYDGATE.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>Well, if you will have it so, I do like it. I
         like it better than making a fool of myself
         by begging where it's of no use!
         Understand then, that it is what I like to do!</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>Spoken with such violent that she flinches: but she's not

         <p>I think perhaps he does grab her arm - possibly much
            more tightly than he means to.</p>

         <p>He turns, and walks out, slamming the bedroom door.</p>

         <p>She stands quite still until she's heard the front door slam.
            Then moving in a very quiet, controlled way - she might
            still be trembling a bit - she sits down at the looking-glass
            again.</p>

         want to sell our furniture, and take a house
         in Bridge Street, where the rooms are like
         cages. If we are to live in that way let us
         at least leave Middlemarch.</blockquote>

         <p>LYDGATE coming towards us down the ward, walking
            fast with his ASSISTANT and TWO NURSES struggling
            to keep up. We can't hear what they are talking about.
            The ASSISTANT and NURSES are asking him questions.</p>

         <p>Other DOCTORS and NURSES call to him as he marches
            on; he looks hunted and gives brief, preoccupied answers.</p>

         <p>We hear voices over discussing LYDGATE and his affairs
            ... the voices are from people at VINCY's party, but we
            don't know that yet.</p>

      <blockquote><u>DR. MINCHIN</u> [VO]
         <br>Cholera? Here in Middlemarch? I shall be
         extremely surprised if it comes so far.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>MR. STANDISH</u> [VO]
         <br>Well there's cholera in London, cholera in
         Birmingham, why should Middlemarch be
         left behind?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>CHICHELY</u> [VO]
         <br>Young Lydgate seems to think it's coming ­
         spends all his time at the new hospital
         preparing for it.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>WRENCH</u> [VO]
         <br>Don't you believe it, he's just keeping out
         of the way of his creditors!</blockquote>

            FEBRUARY 1832. NIGHT 67. (1915).</div>
      </div>

      <div>
         <p>It's a big open-house evening - more of a soiree
            than a dinner party.</p>

         <p>WRENCH and his cronies in a group that includes DR.
            MINCHIN, MR. CHICHELY, STANDISH and
            FAREBROTHER.</p>

         <p>As WRENCH finishes, CHICHELY, MINCHIN and
            STANDISH laugh quite loudly, attracting attention from
            the far end of the room, where we can see VINCY and
            MRS. VINCY, looking jolly as usual. ROSAMOND,
            looking serene, and LYDGATE, looking pale, drawn, at
            odds with the world.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>FAREBROTHER</u>
         <br>Come, Mr Wrench, be candid. You're too
         clever not to see what good work Lydgate
         is doing ... Middlemarch will be better able
         to cope with the cholera if it comes than
         any town in the Midlands, thanks to
         Lydgate's work.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>MINCHIN</u>
         <br>And you should be obliged to Lydgate,
         Wrench, for he's sent you the cream of
         his patients.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>WRENCH</u>
         <br>Well, it's his own fault if he's lost half his
         practice. Arrogance don't go down well in
         Middlemarch.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>STANDISH</u>
         <br>He lives at a great rate, too, for a man with
         his way to make. I suppose his grand
         relations in the North back him up.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>CHICHELY</u>
         <br>I hope they do, else he shouldn't have
         married that lovely girl we were all so fond
         of.</blockquote>

      <p class="centered">[Page]
         6/4</p>


      <div>
         <p>He says that in an unconsciously petulant way, so that
            they laugh at him.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>CHICHELY</u>
         <br>Well hang it, you're bound to hear a
         grudge against a man who carries off the
         prettiest girl in town!</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>They're still laughing at him a bit, goodhumouredly, and
            we can see ROSAMOND at the top of the table, framed
            by their dark jowly faces: she's still as lovely as ever, and
            seems serene, though LYDGATE by her side looks almost
            desperate.</p>

         <p>FAREBROTHER through all that, a bit worried and
            watchful, not finding the jokes so funny as the rest of
            them.</p>

      <div>
         <p>ROSAMOND, excited, hurries into the room where
            LYDGATE is sitting at the table finishing breakfast.</p>

      <blockquote><u>ROSAMOND</u>
         <br>Tertius, here is a letter for you!</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He takes it. Looks at the handwriting.</p>

      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u> [surprised]
         <br>My Uncle Godwin!</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>She sits down and waits eagerly while he opens it and
            starts to read. But it's obviously not what she hoped.
            LYDGATE's face is like thunder. She feels scared.</p>

         <p>He looks up from the letter as if he hates her.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>Rosamond: it will be impossible to live
         with you if you continue to deceive me.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He reads from the letter, using the words like blows,
            aiming to hurt.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>"Dear Tertius: don't set your wife to write
         to me when you have anything to ask. It is
         a roundabout wheedling sort of thing which
         I should not have credited you with. I
         never choose to write to a woman on
         matters of business. As to my supplying
         you with a thousand pounds, I can do
         nothing of the sort."</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He tosses the letter across the table to ROSAMOND.</p>
      </div>


      <hr>
      <p class="centered">[Page]
         6/7</p>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>Read the rest yourself: it sticks in my throat.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>She reads it silently while LYDGATE sits there silently
            raging: there's more savagery boiling up inside him.
            When she's finished, she lays the letter down, and sits
            quite still, "intrenching herself in quiet passivity against
            her husband's wrath".</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>Will this be enough to convince you of the
         harm you do with your secret meddling?</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>She sits still, with lowered gaze. Her passivity enrages
            him. He might have to get up, he has such an urge
            to violent action.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>I had nearly resolved on going to
         Quallingham myself. It would have cost
         me pain to do it, yet it might have been of
         some use. But it has never been of any use
         to me to think of anything - I'm at the
         mercy of your devices! If you mean to
         resist every wish I express, for God's sake
         say so and defy me! I shall at least know
         what I am doing then!</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>Now she does look at him, and she looks so meek, so
            victimised that even now he feels a wavering, a hopeless
            tenderness ... she is, after all, as lovely as ever, and she
            looks so pitiable.</p>

         <p>He speaks much more gently:</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>Oh, Rosamond. Can't you see that nothing
         can be so fatal as a lack of openness, of
         confidence between us. Am I such an
         unreasonable, furious brute? Why should
         you not be open with me?</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>Still silence.</p>
      </div>


      <hr>
      <p class="centered">[Page]
         6/8</p>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>Will you only say that you have been
         mistaken, and that I may depend on your
         not acting secretly in future?</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>Now as she looks at him, there are tears in her eyes.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>ROSAMOND</u>
         <br>You expect me to make promises, when
         you have used such cruel words to me. I
         have not been used to language of that
         kind, and I think you ought to apologise.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>A little tremor at the end there, she genuinely feels ill­
            used.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>ROSAMOND</u>
         <br>You spoke of its being impossible to live
         with me. Certainly you have not made my
         life pleasant of late. I think it was to be
         expected that I should try to avert some of
         the hardships which our marriage has
         brought on me.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>LYDGATE can't help wincing at that "not made my life
            pleasant" - it's so mild, so understated, compared to what
            he said.</p>

         <p>He looks at her. So lovely. Come on, one last big effort:</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>Rosamond. You should allow for a man's
         words when he's disappointed and
         provoked. You and I can't have opposite
         interests. I cannot separate my happiness
         from yours. I should never have been
         angry with you if you had been open
         with me.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>ROSAMOND</u>
         <br>I only wished to prevent you from hurrying
         us into wretchedness without any necessity.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>The tears are flowing fast now: she genuinely feels ill­
            used and has lots of sympathy for herself.</p>
      </div>


      <hr>
      <p class="centered">[Page]
         6/9</p>


      <blockquote><u>ROSAMOND</u>
         <br>It is so very hard to be disgraced here
         among all the people we know, and to live
         in such a miserable way. I wish I had died
         with the baby.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He puts his arms around her as she sobs quietly. He feels
            utterly wretched, utterly hopeless.<a href="#note-454" target="FN" title="link to note"><img src="diamond-icon.png" alt="link to note"></a></p>

         <p>LYDGATE strides through the ward, accompanied by his
            medical team.</p>

         <p>We want to somehow get the feeling of LYDGATE being
            caged in, imprisoned in this echoing building where all
            paths lead to the same point - perhaps jump-cut or
            superimpose shots of his pounding the wards like a
            panther in his cage ...</p>

         <p>He stands in front of a dying patient's bed ... the patient's
            mouth, like a black hole, opening and closing
            meaninglessly.</p>

         <p>LYDGATE's ASSISTANTS are talking to him, but it
            comes out as indecipherable echoing chatter.</p>

         <p>There is a phial of opium amongst other medicines on a
            tray or trolley by the dying patient's bed. He finds
            himself staring at the bottle.</p>

         <p>He picks it up and walks away while his assistants are still
            talking, leaving them staring after him.</p>

         <p>LYDGATE is playing billiards with HORROCK, the foxy
            horse trader of few words. HIRAM FORD is scoring.</p>

         <p>We can see FRED VINCY among those watching in the
            background.</p>

         <p>LYDGATE looks very intense, his eyes are glittering. He
            needs to look like a good player. He has his jacket off
            and looks strong and powerful.</p>

         <p>He judges the shot quickly, then plays it with control,
            flair and power. He goes in off the red: the ball fairly
            rockets into the pocket. A little roar of approval goes up.</p>

         <p>He laughs aloud, straightens, and takes money off
            BAMBRIDGE and HORROCK.</p>

         <p>HORROCK goes to play his shot. He has only two balls
            to play with, and plays safe, or as safe as he can. Very
            deadpan, is HORROCK.</p>

         <p>It's LYDGATE's turn again.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>BAMBRIDGE</u>
         <br>Two pounds says you don't pot red Mr.
         Lydgate.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>Make it five.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>BAMBRIDGE</u>
         <br>Aye, if you will.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>It's a difficult shot. LYDGATE makes it. More reaction
            from SPECTATORS.</p>

         <p>LYDGATE takes his money. He's sort of unhealthily
            excited.</p>

         <p>In on FRED VINCY's face. He's very surprised at
            LYDGATE. He's been in this sort of situation before
            himself, but he never thought LYDGATE was the type.</p>

      <div>
         <p>It's much quieter round the billiard table now. But even
            more SPECTATORS. We can hear drunken singing from
            the other bar, but things are serious now in this one.
            LYDGATE plays his shot, he's trying to go in off the red
            as he did before, but this time just misses - the ball rattles
            in the jaws of the pocket, but stays out.</p>

         <p>LYDGATE gives a short bitter laugh as he straightens and
            hands over the money. He doesn't seem to have much
            left in his wad.</p>

         <p>HORROCK leans on the table and in a very cool way, as
            if it's the easiest thing in the world, plays three cannons in
            quick succession.</p>

      <blockquote><u>BAMBRIDGE</u>

         <br>There is a slight irregularity of the pulse.
         The insomnia, in itself, would not be
         anything to worry about. But you seem to
         be over-extending yourself; it would be
         well for you to relax your attention to

      <blockquote><u>BULSTRODE</u>
         <br>That is what I hope to do. If the cholera

      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>

         doing your share towards protecting
         Middlemarch from infection - and if the

         admit that the arrangements in the hospital
         are a great public good.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>BULSTRODE</u>
         <br>True; but I have in any case been

         <p>LYDGATE stares at him. It's a moment before he can
            pull himself together. He feels terribly hurt and let down.
            He knew BULSTRODE was a bit of a cold fish, but he

         course, but that's nothing ... the symptoms
         you describe are consistent with delirium
         tremens, again not fatal in itself. His liver
         might give out at any time, his system is
         full of poison, and I'm worried about his
         heart and lungs. I've seen men pull
         through worse and live to tell the tale.</blockquote>

         <p>RAFFLES' weak querulous waily voice, and MRS.
            ABEL's responses. We can't hear the words, but this is
            the gist:</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>RAFFLES</u> [VO]
         <br>Ah, I'm going, I'm going, I feel it, for
         pity's sake, woman, for the love of Christ,
         let me have a drop of brandy, I'm going I
         tell you ...</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>MRS. ABEL</u>
         <br>Ooh, I don't know, I couldn't take it on
         myself, more than my place is worth ...</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>RAFFLES</u>
         <br>Oh, God, I'm dying, I'm going ...</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>MRS. ABEL</u>
         <br>I'II go and ask the master then ...</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>She knocks and enters the bedroom.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>MRS. ABEL</u>
         <br>Mr. Bulstrode, sir, shall I give him a little
         brandy or port wine just to settle him?
         He's terrible restless and feels himself
         sinking. What do you think, sir, shall I?</blockquote>


      <div>

         key to the wine-cooler, sir?</blockquote>

      </div>


      <blockquote><u>MRS. ABEL</u>

         poor soul, a little drop of what you fancy

            hear the faint snuffly sound with very long pauses in
            between.</p>

         <p>BULSTRODE's face.
            Carefully, deliberately, he takes the opium phial and

      <div>
         <p>BULSTRODE rises. But before he can speak, HAWLEY
            gets up.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>HAWLEY</u>
         <br>Mr. Chairman, I request permission to
         speak on a matter of public feeling. I think
         most gentlemen here know what I'm
         talking about.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>HAWLEY has a formidable public manner. Rumble of
            "hear hears" and tapping on the table.</p>

         <p>BULSTRODE looks alarmed, and sits down.</p>
      </div>

      <blockquote><u>HAWLEY</u>
         <br>I am speaking now not simply for myself,
         but for a group of my fellow townsmen,
         eight in all, all present here today. We call
         upon Mr. Bulstrode to resign, immediately
         and for good, from all the public positions
         which he holds, not simply as a tax payer,
         but as a gentleman among gentlemen.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>BULSTRODE's face. LYDGATE's face.
            FAREBROTHER's face.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>HAWLEY</u>
         <br>There are practices, and there are acts,
         which the law cannot visit, though they
         may be worse than many things which are
         legally punishable. A man now dead, a
         man who died in Mr. Bulstrode's home,
         alleged to more than one person that Mr.
         Bulstrode was for many years engaged in
         nefarious practices - that he won his
         great fortune by dishonest means and held
         on to it by worse. I call upon Mr.
         Bulstrode either to deny and confute those
         allegations now, or else to withdraw from
         all those positions which he could only hold
         as a gentleman amongst gentlemen.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He sits down with a thump, bristling and glaring.</p>

         <p>BULSTRODE is stricken and shaking - it seems at first
            that he won't be able to speak. Eliot says he speaks
            from a sitting position, but I think it's better if he
            manages to stand, but only just:</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>BULSTRODE</u>
         <br>I protest ... against the sanction of
         proceedings against me which are ... which
         are dictated by hatred. Who - who shall be
         my accuser?</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He gains more strength and spirit now, confronting his
            enemies:</p>

      <blockquote><u>HAWLEY</u>
         <br>Answer the charges.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>BULSTRODE</u>
         <br>Not men whose ... profession is a tissue of
         chicanery, who spend their income on
         sensual enjoyments, while I have devoted
         mine to advancing the best objects for this
         life and the next!</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>A rumble of discontent from the word "chicanery"
            onwards, but HAWLEY is back on his feet and
            thundering almost before BULSTRODE has finished.</p>

         <p>BULSTRODE sinks down slowly.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>HAWLEY</u>
         <br>If you mean me, sir, I call upon you and
         everyone else to the inspection of my
         professional life! I repudiate your canting
         Christianity and call on you again to
         answer the charges laid against you or
         resign!</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>POWDERELL </u>

      <blockquote><u>HAWLEY</u> [really angry, a Dog of War]
         <br>And as to the way I spend my income: I
         don't maintain thieves and cheat offspring
         of their inheritance in order to set myself
         up as a saintly kill-joy!</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>POWDERELL </u>

      <blockquote><u>POWDERELL </u>
         <br>Mr. Bulstrode, it is not desirable, I think,
         to prolong the present discussion. Since
         you seem unwilling or unable to answer
         immediately the allegations made, I
         recommend you at present, as one of those
         who hopes to see your reinstatement in
         respect, to quit the room now, and avoid
         further hindrance to business.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>Mildly spoken, but another crushing blow.</p>

         <p>BULSTRODE stares at him as one betrayed, picks up his
            hat, but has to grab at the edge of the table to save himself
            from falling. Clearly he can't walk unaided. But no one
            goes to his aid.</p>

         <p>LYDGATE, with a terrible sinking feeling of disaster,
            feels that he has to do it. It is, as Eliot says, like putting
            his sign-manual to the association.</p>

         <p>He helps BULSTRODE walk slowly out of the room,
            watched first in silence, then by a growing crescendo of
            whispers.</p>

         <p>LYDGATE and BULSTRODE go through the door, and
            it closes behind them.</p>

         don't know. It's one of those cases which
         are judged on a man's character - and
         Bulstrode's character has enveloped me you
         see, in the public eye, because I took his
         money. Well, it's done now, and can't

         <br>Oh, it is hard! You meant to lead a higher
         life than the common, and to find better
         ways. I cannot bear to rest in this as
         unchangeable. There is no sorrow I have
         thought about more than this: to love what
         is great, and try to reach it, and yet to fail.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
         <br>Yes, I had some ambition. I meant
         everything to be different with me. I
         thought I had strength and mastery.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>DOROTHEA</u>
         <br>But suppose we kept on the hospital on the

         you. You might still win a great fame, like

         <p>After a moment she speaks gently.</p>

      <blockquote><u>MRS. BULSTRODE</u>
         <br>Is there anything that we can do for
         Rosamond and her husband before we
         leave Middlemarch? Walter says that
         they will have almost nothing.</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>BULSTRODE</u>
         <br>Dr. Lydgate has rejected any further
         service from me, Harriet. He has returned the
         thousand pounds I lent him. Mrs.
         Casaubon advanced him that sum. There is
         his letter.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>It lies open on the table. Neither of them move.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote><u>BULSTRODE</u>
         <br>But we might do something for your
         nephew Fred. He might be willing to take
         over this house, as tenant. Caleb Garth,
         before he left my service, told me that Fred
         was much changed, and was likely to turn
         out very well. Would it be of satisfaction
         to you Harriet, if he were to take Stone
         Court?</blockquote>


      <blockquote><u>MRS. BULSTRODE</u>
         <br>Yes, it would. You are .... very good Nicholas.</blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He turns his head slowly. He is not very good. He is
            very bad, and he is pretty sure he's going to hell.</p>

      <blockquote><u>GEORGE ELIOT</u> [VO]
         <br>All who have cared for Fred Vincy and
         Mary Garth will like to know that these two
         achieved a solid mutual happiness. Fred
         became rather distinguished as a farmer ­
         but was always prone to believe he could
         make money by the purchase of a horse
         which turned out badly. They had three
         children, all boys, never became rich, but
         saved enough to become owners of Stone
         Court.</blockquote>

         <p>Ladislaw is just in the background of the shot, though,

      <blockquote><u>GEORGE ELIOT</u> [VO]
         <br>She had no dreams of being praised above
         other women, feeling that there was always
         something better which she might have
         done, if she had only been better and
         known better. Her full nature spent itself
         in deeds which left no great name on the
         earth. But the effect of her being on those
         around her was incalculable; for the
         growing good of the world is partly
         dependent on unhistoric acts, and on all
         those Dorotheas who live faithfully their
         hidden lives, and rest in unvisited tombs.</blockquote>
