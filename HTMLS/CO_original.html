      <p id="comment-50"> <b>Commentary 1: Scenes 1/1-1/6</b></p>




      <p>It was the BBC’s Executive Producer, Michael Wearing, who suggested to Andrew Davies
         that his screenplay of <em>Middlemarch</em> might begin like

         a Western: ‘A man rides into town…’  The man is Tertius Lydgate, the idealistic and
         ambitious young doctor. As his stagecoach passes

         beside a newly-dug railway cutting where track is being laid he cries to a fellow
         passenger with triumphant expectation: ‘The future!’

         The exclamation is doubly ironic. By the end of Episode 1, Lydgate will already be
         feeling thwarted by Middlemarch’s entrenched provincial

         loyalties. And, as television viewers of 1994, we are strangers being invited into
         a heritage England of 1829, before the first Reform

         Bill and the dawning of the modern industrial age, epitomised by the opening shot
         of sheep being driven along an untrammelled country lane.</p>




      <p><em>Middlemarch</em> the novel, of course, begins with the story of ‘Miss Brooke’ which follows a ‘Prelude’
         in which the narrator

         establishes her guise as a historian with the deepest sympathy for the plight of woman.
         This is matched by a playful perspective of

         distanciation framed here in the example of St Theresa whose ‘passionate, ideal nature’
         sought ‘some illimitable satisfaction, some object

         which would never justify weariness, which would reconcile self-despair with the rapturous
         consciousness of life beyond self’(Prelude, pp.1-2). It is easy

         to read this, as many have, as prefiguring the story of the idealistic and devout
         Dorothea Brooke. Yet Eliot is surely embracing here not

         only womankind in general, but the struggles of noble idealism itself in a world without
         ‘coherent social faith and order’(Prelude, p.2). And it is this

         larger theme that the novel pursues from a wide variety of perspectives.</p>




      <p>The director of the BBC’s <em>Middlemarch</em>, Anthony Page, indicated that ‘it was a deliberate choice of Andrew’s not to

         have any kind of voice over which you could have done. I mean you could have had a
         narration, because she does like to comment and to

         moralise, and I mean I can imagine an adaptation where you would do that … which would
         give it a very different, much more philosophical

         and literary feeling. This is much more direct and popular and modern’ (Page, 1993,
         pp. 60-1 and pp.66-7)</p>




      <p>The choice to begin the adaptation with the Lydgate/Middlemarch story also reinforces
         the broader historical and sociological canvas that

         Eliot’s novel embraces, and reminds us, perhaps (pace Beaty, 1960), that in the sequence
         of composition it was this narrative that came to her

         first, and that Dorothea’s story was conceived of independently. The two parts were
         combined into a single novel during the writing process,

         the sequencing of which was also determined, to some extent, by the decision to publish
         in serialised form, in 8 bi-monthly parts, before

         the ending of the novel had been envisaged.</p>




      <p>Andrew Davies’ opening follows Lydgate’s coach into town, arriving at The White Hart
         hotel in the bustling market square, serving to locate

         Middlemarch, and introduce us, en passant, to some of its local traders including
         Mawmsey, the grocer. The inn-keeper greets the newcomer as

         he steps down: ‘Is it Dr Lydgate? …  I understand you’ve purchased Dr. Peacock’s practice?’
         This is an embellishment of the original Shooting

         script (‘Dr. Lydgate! Welcome to Middlemarch!’), which reveals his arrival is already
         perceived as a form of takeover. This is then reinforced

         visually via a tracking shot that brings a refreshed Lydgate, tankard in hand and
         a touristic gleam in his eye, through the busy market

         to the pie stall, where the local fare on offer is juxtaposed in poetic montage with
         a specimen we next see Lydgate dissecting in his study –

         we will discover this later to be Lydgate’s quest to understand ‘primitive tissue’.</p>




      <p>In the midst of this bravura opening sequence, where constant motion is underscored
         by the orchestration of rhythmic strings, Lydgate’s arrival

         in Middlemarch is counterbalanced with the introduction of the Brooke sisters, Dorothea
         and Celia, seen riding across open country with abandon.

         Eliot tells us early of Dorothea’s indulgent enjoyment of riding and the sexual attraction
         it provoked:</p>




      <p>'Most men thought her bewitching when she was on horseback ... Riding

         was an indulgence which she allowed herself in spite of conscientious

         qualms; she felt that she enjoyed it in a pagan sensuous way, and always

         looked forward to renouncing it.' (Ch.1, p.11)</p>




      <p>Andrew Davies’ stage directions precis this observation efficiently, and frame our
         heroine in close-up: ‘But the first thing we see is Dorothea’s

         face, rapt, intent, glowing, in a kind of quiet ecstasy as she canters along. Her
         lips are parted. We can hear her breathing. We are going to hear

         and see enough of her spirituality later on, for now let’s see a beautiful and passionate
         young woman.’</p>




      <p>Our indulgence in this spirited but innocent scene of sisters at leisure is arrested
         by their short-cut return through woodland where they

         encounter a poor itinerant labouring family, with young children. Before we learn
         of Dorothea’s spirituality, we see not only her beauty and

         passion, but also her compassion and distress in encountering human misery. This will
         prove to be her more enduring and endearing quality. It is

         immediately reinforced by her declaration (back at the stables) to give up riding,
         and the introduction of their jovial but parsimonius uncle

         (Robert Hardy) explaining to his estate steward Roach why he won’t spend money on
         repairing broken fencing. As Andrew Davies notes in stage

         directions for Shooting script scene 1/7, ‘Brooke always favours the middle way even
         when, as in the present case, there isn't one’.</p>




      <p>The discovery of Stamford, by location manager Sam Breckman, was a major breakthrough
         in the realisation of the town of Middlemarch. As Anthony

         Page observed: ‘there were big areas that weren’t spoiled so you could get long tracking
         shots – big areas that looked like a town lived in at

         that point, it was the only place we could find like that.’ (Page 1993, p.26).</p>

      <p id="comment-51"> <b>Commentary 2: Scene 1/7</b></p>




      <p>Scene 1/7 is the first to place Dorothea and Celia Brooke in the domestic environment
         of their

         own rooms at Tipton Grange. Its significance for Andrew Davies is apparent in correspondence
         early

         in the development of the script with the first producer attached to the project,
         David Snodin. In

         a letter of 10 July 1991, Davies is concerned that Snodin had wished to omit this
         scene because 'all

         it tells us is that Dorothea does not want to wear a cross as jewellery and that someone's
         coming to

         dinner’. In a fuller extract from this letter attached to the Shooting script, Davies
         offers four

         detailed reasons why this scene is crucial as exposition of the sisters' characters
         and attitudes

         in Episode 1, but his adaptive methods here are also worth exploring.</p>


      <p>For instance, Davies expertly selects and applies verbatim phrases from Eliot’s dialogue
         and

         descriptions of the sisters' reactions in Chapter 1. He does so both in their speeches
         and in his

         stage directions. Celia's arguments in favour of them wearing the jewellery (not to
         would be lacking

         'in respect to Mamma's memory' and 'surely... there are women in heaven now who wore
         jewels') are

         taken from just one paragraph on pp.14-15 of the novel. Davies, however, intersperses
         them throughout

         the scene to maintain the momentum of Celia's attempts at persuasion. In the Shooting
         script, too,

         Dorothea dismisses the thought of wearing a cross as a 'trinket' only to be suddenly
         taken, just as

         she is in Chapter 1 with the sheer beauty of the gems. She marvels ‘how deeply colours
         seem to ...

         penetrate one ... like scent. They look like fragments of heaven’. Yet by the Post-production
         script,

         Dorothea’s attitude to wearing the jewels in company has lost the more judgemental
         line developed

         from Eliot’s dialogue (‘Who knows to what level I may sink?’), instead retaining a
         more ambivalent

         and suggestive, ‘Perhaps I shall…’ In performance, Aubrey subtly conveys the way Dorothea
         is torn

         between physical feelings evoked by the gems and her urge to renounce worldly temptations.</p>


      <p>The deliberate omission of elements from the novel is also a strategy Davies’ employs
         when adapting

         this scene. Hints at Dorothea's spiritual and puritanical principles are reined back
         by the

         screenwriter for his 1990s audience. For the benefit of the actor and director only,
         he notes in

         the stage direction, that Dorothea’s rejection of the jewels is 'not just Puritanical
         asceticism'.

         Dorothea's goodness is conveyed rather through her social conscience as embodied in
         her plans for

         the farmworkers' cottages, even if Celia's pragmatic 'Yes, very nice, but you know
         Uncle. They will

         never be built' sows the seeds for Episode 6's stark summation of Dorothea's idealism.</p>


      <p>Davies uses the scene to reveal Dorothea’s and Celia’s differences as sensual young
         women. Celia,

         the younger teenager, is excited to wear the jewels at a dinner where they will have
         guests; she

         relishes the attention they will grant her and the timing of her request to Dorothea
         to look at the

         jewellery is no coincidence. At first Dorothea consciously rejects the jewels but
         then her senses

         take over as she studies them as Eliot notes 'under a current of feeling, as sudden
         as the gleam'

         (p.17) of the emeralds. The difference is that Davies focuses Dorothea’s reaction
         on the physical

         whereas Eliot blends this with the spiritual.</p>


      <p>Both Davies' scripting and the decisions made later in the direction, lighting and
         editing of this

         scene enhance this early example of Dorothea’s thoughtful yet mercurial character.
         Time collapses in

         the screen version. As noted by Bazalgette and James (1994, p.12), the scene begins
         in daylight with Dorothea

         rationalising her plans but by the time she is handling the emeralds, only a few minutes
         later in real time,

         it is candlelight that illuminates them and in the process the potential for Dorothea’s
         emotional depth.</p>

      <p id="comment-80"> <b>Commentary 3: Scenes 1/19-1/20</b></p>




      <p>This after dinner scene, focusing on the newly-made friends Lydgate and the Reverend
         Farebrother, displays

         many of Andrew Davies’ most productive adaptative techniques in a very short space.
         The first of these is the

         omission of characters that might initially seem superfluous to the drama, in this
         case, the total removal of

         Farebrother’s aunt and mother in the Shooting script. However, by the Post-production
         script they have

         reappeared at the start of the scene to hand over some glasses to ‘Camden dear’ and
         bid him goodnight. The

         familial endearments and the fact that, rather than a housemaid, these ladies provide
         the glasses is enough

         to indicate both the closeness of Farebrother’s dependants and their financial situation.
         Whether this

         re-inclusion was a script-editing decision or a directorial one is unknown, but the
         effect is to add depth to

         the depiction of Farebrother’s domestic situation and social position in Middlemarch,
         whilst representing minor

         characters who in the novel have spent some time getting the measure of Dr Lydgate
         over tea.</p>




      <p>From here, Davies seeds the relationship between these two young intelligent men that
         will persist throughout

         his dramatization. First, he establishes the fact that they have a shared interest
         in science, though for

         Farebrother it is an absorbing hobby rather than a burning ambition for professional
         research and discovery

         as it is for Lydgate. In this respect, Davies closely follows Eliot’s Chapter 17,
         but from here he uses concision

         and integrates elements from other chapters in the novel to indicate how different
         Lydgate and Farebrother are

         in outlook and understanding. For instance, in the Shooting script Lydgate claims
         that ‘All of [his research]

         is possible here in Middlemarch’, later refined in the Post-production script to ‘in
         the country, you can follow

         your own course more easily. People let you alone. You can get on with your own life’.
         In this instance Davies

         is drawing from Lydgate’s earlier conversation in the novel with Bulstrode, when he
         states ‘Any valid professional

         aims may often find a freer, if not a richer field, in the provinces.’ (Ch.13, p.187).
         Most importantly, in doing

         this, Davies reveals that Lydgate has as yet no idea of the trammels that the Middlemarch
         social web will place

         on him both personally and in his research. </p>




      <p>In response to this, Farebrother, who Alan Palmer argues ‘is not part of the Middlemarch
         mind’ (2005, p.166-7)

         issues a gentle warning to Lydgate that things are not as simple in the Middlemarch
         community as they might seem.

         This is the instigation of Farebrother’s role as Lydgate’s tactful guide to living
         in the town and this sense is

         enhanced by changes made between Shooting script and Post-production script. Scene
         1/20 in the Shooting script

         takes place on the walk back to Lydgate’s from Farebrother’s – this is the moment
         when the reverend chooses to

         enlighten the doctor about the potential negative effect on his research plans of
         his voting choice for the chaplaincy.

         In the Post-production script scene 1/20 is subsumed into an extension of scene 1/19,
         so that the warning is delivered

         as part of their fireside chat. Farebrother’s empathy and understanding of how Middlemarch
         could work upon Lydgate

         is sensitively and intuitively delivered through the tone of Simon Chandler’s performance
         in this scene. This eloquently

         foreshadows Palmer’s view regarding how the relationship between these two characters
         unfolds in the novel when he

         asserts that:</p>


      <p>the mutual ascription of motives and states of mind is far more successful in this
         case than between Lydgate and

         his wife.     (2005, p.167)</p>




      <p>This is voiced in the final lines of the scene where Farebrother insists that however
         his new friend may vote ‘I simply

         cannot afford to do without you, Lydgate’. While this might also be viewed as generous
         hyperbole on Farebrother’s part,

         these two definitely identify as kindred spirits.</p>

      <p id="comment-90"> <b>Commentary 4: Scene 1/21</b></p>




      <p>In just two and a half minutes this scene introduces the television audience of Middlemarch
         to the Vincy family,

         framing Rosamond, as George Eliot does in Chapter 11, between her doting mother and
         her brother, Fred. Initially, Andrew

         Davies preserves from the novel two clear distinctions between Rosamond and Mrs Vincy
         in terms of manners – Rosamond cannot

         understand how any sophisticated home could stink of kippers this late in the day
         – and language, when she recommends that

         ‘the pick of’ is a phrase no woman of class would use. In the screen version, this
         distinction is perpetuated in the

         morning leisure activities the two women choose – Mrs Vincy is mending, while Rosamond
         is engaged in the more decorative

         occupation of painting.</p>




      <p>When Fred arrives downstairs, he immediately provokes his sister by addressing her
         as ‘Rosie’ – a childish shortening

         of her name. This is firmly met with her correcting riposte: ‘Rosamond’. This first
         exchange is of Davies’ invention to

         show that their bantering relationship reflects nothing of a younger sister who looks
         up to her brother as initially is

         the case with Maggie and Tom Tulliver in <em>The Mill on the Floss</em> or as nostalgically viewed in Eliot’s own recollections of

         her childhood with brother Isaac in her ‘Brother and Sister’ sonnet sequence of 1869.
         Rosamond is a young woman keen to

         have her views felt in the household. She follows her mother into the breakfast room
         to quiz Fred on his choice of a

         ‘grilled bone’ and in the rest of the scene Davies produces a pared down version of
         their longer banter from the novel.

         The crossfire of their quick exchanges is lightened in the screen version through
         the performances of Trevyn McDowell and

         Jonathan Firth. They are like modern teenagers arguing, but an affection underlies
         their verbal sparring. This is also

         conveyed in the slightly conspiratorial rolling of eyes they share as their mother
         insists that they must visit their Uncle

         Featherstone or they will never receive a legacy from him. The audience is also aware
         of more human contact between these

         three characters than in the scenes at Tipton. Furthermore, Mrs Vincy’s kiss on Fred’s
         cheek as he sits down to breakfast and

         hug for her daughter on her decision to ride to Stone Court, neither of which are
         given as stage directions, can also be

         viewed as a sign of parental indulgence that has led to these rather spoilt offspring.</p>




      <p>Certainly the interchanges between brother and sister are more transactional in the
         novel with Rosamond calculating

         that she must pander to Fred by accompanying his ‘wheezy performance’ (Ch.11, p.154)
         on the flute for an hour in order

         that he will accompany her to Stone Court the following day.</p>




      <p>The reworking of the location for this scene, which in the Shooting script takes place
         in the drawing room-cum-breakfast room

         at the Vincys’, was brought about by the production’s choice of a town house in Stamford
         which had two smaller reception rooms

         on its first floor. Lighting these rooms, and deciding on the camera positions, posed
         a challenge to experienced cinematographer,

         Brian Tufano. But the ‘bright high-key’ effect he creates of strong morning light
         pouring in to both rooms (in actuality from

         four powerful scissor lifts and scaffold-mounted lamps and two interior lamps bouncing
         light off polystyrene panels) also

         contributes to the characterisation of Fred and particularly Rosamond in this expositional
         scene. In addition, close-ups from

         different camera angles later allowed the director/editor choices in the cutting-room
         about character, point-of-view and emphasis.

         Once in the breakfast room, Rosamond is lit mostly from the side, enhancing both her
         head movements and facial expressions as she

         quick-wittedly delivers her lines. This lighting also successfully facilitates the
         transition between the two rooms that helps to

         give this scene its pace.</p>




      <p>Another indication of how technical adaptive aspects of the production meld with the
         script to result in an overall look and

         produce an auto-suggestive effect on the audience is summed up by this comment from

      <p>One could say that the morning effect is in the eye of the beholder … what you do
         is create a bright high-key effect

         of bright sunlight … filtering into a room and the rest is conveyed by the fact that
         it was breakfast and that they talk

         about getting up at 10.30 in the morning and having a late start to the day.</p>

      <p id="comment-100"> <b>Commentary 5: Scene 1/27</b></p>




      <p>Scene 1/27 portrays the introduction of Rosamond to Lydgate which takes place at Stone
         Court. It comes

         towards the end of a scene sequence which has focussed on the Vincys and their extended
         family. While Andrew

         Davies stays close to Eliot’s depiction of this first meeting, his script imbues it
         with greater ambivalence,

         foreshadowing the way the relationship will unfold.</p>




      <p>For instance, at the opening of the scene, Lydgate enters while Rosamond sings and
         plays ‘Home Sweet Home’,

         at Featherstone’s request. He pauses just inside the door, immediately captivated
         at the sight and sound

         of her. The choice of song is also significant: Rosamond is the epitome of that ideal
         of Victorian womanhood,

         the Angel of the Hearth, at this moment. The first page of this scene is missing from
         the Shooting script

         which means we do not know exactly when Lydgate’s initial vision of Rosamond was decided
         upon. But we do

         know that in Chapter 16 of the novel, Lydgate comments to Rosamond that he did not
         hear her sing at Stonecourt.

         The interpolation of this moment is thus deliberate on Davies’ part.</p>




      <p>The ‘love-at-first-sight’ encounter at Stonecourt causes Rosamond to reflect at the
         end of Chapter 12,

         and this idea of being immediately smitten is embedded in Davies’ stage directions
         for scene 1/27. For example,

         of Rosamond: ‘She manages to take his hand without actually replying: she's doing
         it all with her eyes’, and of

         Lydgate: ‘He says this without taking his eyes off hers.’ They are finding it hard
         to avert their gaze from

         one another.</p>




      <p>The cinematography echoes Davies’ focus on the couple’s reactions to each other and
         captures the moment when

         Rosamond literally and metaphorically takes the whip-hand by deciding to keep this
         first encounter short.

         With her line ‘…where is my whip…Oh’ Davies reveals Rosamond’s artifice ̶ she is actively
         performing the

         role of a maiden in distress, whereas in the novel she goes to retrieve her riding
         whip and Lydgate leaps

         forward to hand it to her. Thus, Davies implies early on the manipulative aspect of
         Rosamond that Eliot takes

         much longer to lay out for her reader. As Daniel Karlin infers, Eliot’s use of prolepsis
         in the metaphor of

         the whip is that ‘power is to be an issue in Lydgate’s relations with Rosamond, and
         in handing her the whip

         he is making a rod for his own back’ (2000, p.29). Rosamond’s pre-planning is made
         apparent at the end of

         Chapter 12 where, the narrator confides that ‘ever since that [Lydgate’s] important
         arrival in Middlemarch,

         [Rosamond] had woven a little future, of which something like this scene was the necessary
         beginning’ (p.176).</p>




      <p>Rosamond’s manipulative side was certainly on Trevyn McDowell’s mind as she developed
         the role. In her

         interview, she intimated she would have preferred Rosamond to have had an inferior
         singing voice to signal

         her imperfections or to have shown her removing hair pieces as she undressed for bed
         and so reveal that

         her physical perfection is not all natural. However, this was deemed a step too far
         in the depiction by

         Anthony Page, believing it important that the learnt graces and accomplishments Rosamond
         has in the novel

         should be preserved on screen.</p>




      <p>Eliot does, however, show that Rosamond is taken by surprise at her natural reaction
         to Lydgate holding her

         gaze as he hands over the whip ‘Rosamond blushed deeply and felt a certain astonishment.’
         And whereas

         previously she had planned her exit ‘After that, she was really anxious to go’ (Ch.12,
         p.176). It is this

         genuine attraction that McDowell and Hodge capture in their performances, enhanced
         by their television

         history in acting as a couple, for example as Amanda and Bobby in ITV’s <em>London’s Burning</em>

         (1988). The strength of the chemistry between herself and Lydgate is something that
         not even Rosamond has accounted

         for in her plans.</p>

      <p id="comment-105"> <b>Commentary 6: Scenes 1/37-1/40</b></p>




      <p>Scenes 1/37-40 of Episode 1 are dedicated to Brooke’s concern at the prospect of an
         offer of marriage for

         his niece, Casaubon’s letter, Dorothea’s acceptance and Celia’s surprise at the news.
         This is a condensed version

         of affairs compared to the novel, not only in terms of the number of individual events
         shown on screen but the

         timescale of the betrothal.</p>




      <p>The sequence begins in scene 1/37 with Brooke’s and Dorothea’s exchange conveyed by
         a series of shot-reverse-shot

         at medium to close-up distance. Such proximity allows the audience to see the nuances
         of Robert Hardy’s and

         Juliet Aubrey’s performances, while still capturing the way that the scene’s blocking
         echoes and amplifies their

         conversation. Throughout the scene, Brooke moves back and forth between his niece
         and the fireplace; he, for instance,

         surges in to persuade her that ‘a man likes to be master, you know’. Brooke’s circumlocutionary
         dialogue elicits not

         only humour but an even more devout expression of intent in his niece, however, and
         he retreats before Dorothea’s

         placid assurance that her husband should be ‘above me in judgement, experience, knowledge’.
         Ultimately, Brooke and Dorothea

         end the scene in the same frame but, like his novel counterpart who rues how a marriage
         to Casaubon might end, Hardy

         looks dismayed.</p>




      <p>Davies features Casaubon’s missive, too. As soon as Dorothea receives the letter from
         her uncle, Patrick Malahide’s

         whispery voiceover summons a dissolve to Casaubon’s study. The camera tracks Casaubon
         as he walks across his room

         and tightens in medium close-up as he stands in contemplation. The layering of a slowly
         swelling instrumental soundtrack

         with Malahide’s delivery of the letter in voiceover, provides a genuine sense of emotion
         from this most unlikely of suitors.

         The subsequent dissolve between the fireplace in Casaubon’s library and Dorothea’s
         bedroom certainly seems to emphasise

         the connectedness of the two at this point. The dissolve merges their physical spaces
         momentarily until we see Dorothea who,

         now dressed for bed, has evidently been reading and thinking about Casaubon’s letter
         all day and night. Before we cut to 1/40,

         she cradles the letter to her breast. It is a gesture that speaks volumes. In comparison
         to Eliot’s Dorothea who consistently

         exhibits more extreme emotion, trembling and sobbing at Casaubon’s proposal and rewriting
         her acceptance letter three times,

         Aubrey is uncomplicatedly pleased. Her eyes, Davies writes at the end of this four-scene
         sequence, are ‘full of joyful

         certainty’. Importantly, Davies’ characterisation of Dorothea is only enhanced by
         the adaptation’s compression of the sequence,

         which serves to reinforce a lack of deliberation or time for doubts.</p>




      <p>Davies similarly resists some of Eliot’s irony. He acknowledges in a stage direction
         in both versions of the script that

         Casaubon’s declaration is ‘not much of a love letter, but [Dorothea’s] imagination
         can fill out all its deficiencies’,

         echoing closely Eliot’s wry assertion that Dorothea’s ‘faith supplied all that Mr
         Casaubon’s words seemed to leave unsaid’.

         While Eliot also describes the letter’s ‘frigid rhetoric’ being as ‘sincere as the
         bark of a dog’ (Ch.5, p.72), however,

         the simultaneous guilelessness of Aubrey’s performance and her deep, mature voice,
         works to sell Dorothea’s curious attachment

         to a man twenty-seven years her senior.</p>




      <p>Davies’ determination to present a somewhat plausible romance is evident in the Shooting
         script where Casaubon is figured in

         a quasi-Byronic manner. In 1/39, for instance, the adaptation tracks Casaubon’s across
         the library before the dissolve connects

         his space and Dorothea’s own. In Davies’ stage directions in the Shooting script,
         though, we leave the same scene with a somewhat

         ominous image of Casaubon’s ‘black silhouette in the window’. Similarly gothic framing
         is also employed on his arrival to Tipton

         in 1/42. Casaubon’s coach approaches ‘in time with the throbbing music’ and he is
         filmed in profile ‘with a rather frightening

         black hat on.’ When Casaubon greets Dorothea in the scene, the hauteur so mocked by
         Eliot becomes explicitly romantic. Casaubon

         extends his hand to Dorothea who runs down the stairs to him and he humbles himself
         to reassure his fiancé that he is ‘as young

         in experience’ as she is. Casaubon’s Byronic aspect is significantly reduced by the
         time of the Post-production script, though,

         and his courtship visit to Tipton is excised. Perhaps Patrick Malahide’s inherent
         cadaverousness supplied enough gothic drama so

         that the production could establish the novel’s unlikely romance by other means.</p>




      <p>Indeed, while these scenes are significant for what they reveal about Davies’ efforts
         to adapt Casaubon and Dorothea, they also

         demonstrate how he characterises the relationship between the Brooke sisters. Davies
         contrasts a practical Dorothea against a

         frivolous Celia. In the Shooting script, for instance, Dorothea is described sat at
         her desk, working on her plans. This action is

         lost in the relocation of the scene to her bedroom and the newly awake Dorothea is
         only described having just ‘climbed out from

         underneath her bedclothes’. We see instead Celia brushing her hair in a way that reinforces
         Davies’ earlier framing of her vanity

         relative to Dorothea’s denial of self-indulgences. Eliot’s characterisation of Celia
         is markedly different, however. In the novel,

         she is the practical and down-to-earth one and Dorothea the romantic (albeit her emotion
         is directed towards spiritual and philanthropic

         matters). Tellingly, in the same scene in the novel, Celia is described making a toy
         for the curate’s children while Dorothea’s ‘usual

         diligent interest in some occupation’ is lost to a silent ‘reverie’ (Ch.5, p.69) as
         she stares out of the window with her ‘elbow on

         an open book’ (Ch.5, p.68).</p>




      <p>By removing Celia’s unravelling of her sister’s secret engagement, Davies also minimises
         our sense of not only her shrewdness in

         marriage matters (her ‘marvellous quickness’ (Ch.5, p.67)) but the extent of her opposition
         to the match. In combination with the

         compression of events described above, the simplification of Celia’s character thus
         leaves the way free for Dorothea’s curious

         attachment to, in Celia’s words, this latest ‘ugly and learned’ (Ch.5, p.67) man.
         Indeed, the cracks in Dorothea and Casaubon’s

         relationship reveal themselves without either the narrator’s or Celia’s input. Davies
         instead chooses to use the proposal scenes to

         emphasise Dorothea’s determination to marry, despite the counsel of the two people
         to whom she is closest – her uncle and her

         younger sister.</p>

      <p id="comment-110"> <b>Commentary 7: Scene 1/64</b></p>




      <p>Scene 1/64 depicting Dorothea and Casaubon’s engagement celebration at Tipton Grange
         is the first in both the novel and in Andrew

         Davies’ adaptation to bring together residents of Middlemarch and the local landed
         gentry in a social setting. In Chapter 10,

         George Eliot’s narrator emphasises how unusual this was for the early 1830s, commenting
         on Brooke’s ‘miscellaneous invitations’

         and that ‘before Reform had done its notable part, there was a clearer distinction
         of ranks and a dimmer distinction of parties’

         (Ch.10, p.132).</p>




      <p>In his adaptation of this event, Davies enlists Mrs Cadwallader – as he does in several
         other scenes – as a surrogate commentator

         on those around her. She begins by clearly expressing the narrator’s point above in
         her line ‘Brooke has invited half the town as

         well as half the country. What a to-do!’ She is critical of his political aspirations
         and her sensibilities are offended by him

         bringing Vincy, the ribbon maker, and his wife into her social milieu.</p>




      <p>Davies goes further, appropriating some of Lady Chettam’s lines from the novel to
         Mrs Cadwallader, to focalise the scene through her,

         a fact that supports Sarah Cardwell’s view of his adaptive ‘preoccupation with strong
         female characters’ over weaker ones (2005, p.115).

         So, it is Mrs Cadwallader who introduces Lydgate into conversation as the ‘new sawbones’
         rather than Lady Chettam. And Davies’ comic

         putdown that she ‘can remember when medical men knew their place and kept it. With
         the servants’ derives from Lady Chettam’s much less

         acidic view that she likes ‘a medical man more on a footing with the servants; they
         are often all the cleverer’ (Ch.10, p.136).</p>




      <p>Davies expertly reframes time in this scene from the plot of the novel, staging it
         during the day and bringing male and female characters

         together in a pre-dinner reception rather than, as Eliot does, have them talk after
         dinner  -  the men still in the dining room and the

         women in the drawing room. The visual focus is on Dorothea and Casaubon meeting their
         guests with the camera roving over the Vincys and

         Bulstrode before espying Lydgate through a gap in the crowd when Mrs Cadwallader’s
         commentary turns to him. There is a strong sense of

         Cardwell’s argument that that the camera can itself take on the role of narrator in
         a televisual adaptation (2005, p.116), aligning with,

         but also ranging beyond Mrs Cadwallader’s gimlet eye.</p>




      <p>By narrowing the thematic focus here to matters of social rank, Davies omits the more
         personally critical comments from the novel, for

         instance that Mrs Cadwallader and Lady Chettam make about Casaubon ‘drying up faster
         since the engagement’ (Ch.10, p.135). (This perhaps

         caters to a modern viewer’s incredulity that Dorothea can be attracted to Casaubon
         at all.) But this omission may also be due to Davies’

         decision to make this a mixed-gender party. This would certainly support the choice
         made between the Shooting script and the Post-production

         script to cut the middle-aged bachelor Chichley’s comments to Standish in which he
         states his preference for young Rosamond Vincy’s ‘swan neck’

         over Dorothea’s ‘uncommonly fine’ figure. Chichley’s entitled chauvinism may have
         been thinly tolerated in the dining room among male

         acquaintances but would not be here in mixed company. Indeed, in the novel, Eliot’s
         narrator has the last word on him, implying he is all talk.

         When Standish jokingly encourages him to court Rosamond, Chichley shakes his head
         unwilling ‘to incur the certainty of being accepted by the

         woman he would choose’ (Ch.10, p.133).</p>




      <p>Scene 1/64 is therefore cleverly engineered by Davies’ script and the cinematography
         as a prelude to the following after dinner scene – purely

         of the screenwriter’s invention – where Brooke speaks obtusely of reform to the assembled
         representatives of his prospective constituency and

         almost forgets to toast the happy couple.</p>

      <p id="comment-115"> <b>Commentary 8: Scene 1/74</b></p>




      <p>‘“Oh, sir, the loftiest hopes on earth

         Draw lots with meaner hopes: heroic breasts,

         Breathing bad air, run risk of pestilence;”’ (Ch.18, p.269)</p>




      <p>These first three lines of Eliot’s epigraph to Chapter 18 in the novel can be read
         as an ironic comment on Lydgate’s situation in this chapter.

         His heroic ambitions and lofty principles are threatened by the ‘meaner hopes’ of
         his Middlemarch brethren, over the election of a paid chaplain

         to the new fever hospital staff. The mention of ‘bad air’ and the ‘risk of pestilence’
         invokes both the genuine environmental scourge of typhus

         which Lydgate’s new fever hospital is founded to tackle, and the virulence of petty
         politics which threatens to thwart his pioneering work.</p>




      <p>At the start of this chapter, Lydgate finds himself in a frustrating quandary over
         his vested interests in supporting Bulstrode’s investment in

         the hospital (and his evangelical preference Mr Tyke) and his valued friendship with
         the idiosyncratic but genial rector of St Botolph’s, Reverend

         Farebrother. Lydgate has no personal interest (although some political advantage)
         in supporting Bulstrode’s preferred appointment. Nonetheless,

         his fondness for Farebrother, who has been doing the job unpaid and needs the money,
         is tempered by his dislike of the clergyman’s gaming, for

         Lydgate, ‘had an ideal of life which made this subservience of conduct to the gaining
         of small sums thoroughly hateful to him’ (Ch.18, p.272).</p>




      <p>Eliot’s narrator thus underlines Lydgate’s hubris and sense of entitlement, which
         will ultimately provoke the crisis of his marriage: ‘he had

         no power of imagining the part which the want of money plays in determining the actions
         of men.’ Such ignorance, it is made clear, is born of

         moral superiority; the quotidian affairs of money and the parochialism of local politics,
         are to prove the ingredients of his downfall. On the

         day of the hospital board meeting, Lydgate has the first intimations of this claustrophobia,
         ‘feeling the hampering threadlike pressure of small

         social conditions, and their frustrating complexity’ (Ch.18, p.274) and acknowledging
         surprise that at the ‘very outset’ of his project he

         found himself ‘in the grasp of petty alternatives, each of which was repugnant to
         him’ (Ch.18, p.275).</p>




      <p>Although Andrew Davies reduces the number of board members considerably (Eliot has
         a biblical twelve around her table without Lydgate), his script

         adheres closely to Eliot’s own dramatically astute dialogue in scene 1/74, and the
         minor word changes between the Shooting script and the final

         production are inconsequential. The outcome is also the same: Tyke becomes chaplain
         and Lydgate is left disgruntled:</p>




      <p>He was really uncertain whether Tyke were not the more suitable candidate, and yet
         his consciousness told him that if he had been quite free

         from indirect bias he should have voted for Mr Farebrother. The affair of the chaplaincy
         remained a sore point in his memory as a case in

         which this petty medium of Middlemarch had been too strong for him. (Ch.18, p.285)</p>




      <p>Andrew Davies’ closing stage direction is more blunt: ‘He’s furious  ̶  and now he’s
         not at all sure he’s voted the right way, even. Somehow,

         he’s been mugged'.</p>




      <p id="end-of-Ep1">Perhaps the most significant difference in this scene between the Shooting script
         and the final production is its repositioning. The Shooting

         script retains the novel’s sequencing, leaving the newly-wed Mr and Mrs Casaubon to
         their continental honeymoon while focusing on the Lydgate-Vincy

         plot in Middlemarch across Chapters 11-18 (which corresponds to scenes 1/68-1/74).
         However, a decision was taken (possibly as late as the editing

         stage of post-production), to end Episode 1 with scene 1/74 and Lydgate’s humiliation,
         bringing the first half of the Rome scenes (1/75-1/83 covering

         the Casaubons’ first excursion to the gallery and Naumann and Ladislaw’s discovery)
         forward, and inserting them between 1/72 (Lydgate at his studies

         in his lodgings) and 1/74. This change serves two functions it seems. First, it reminds
         the viewer who might have settled in to life in Middlemarch

         that all this while the Casaubons are in Rome. Secondly, it book-ends neatly the first
         episode with Lydgate’s learning curve (from his triumphant

         ‘The Future!’ on arrival to ‘somehow, he’s been mugged’) and brings it to a more dramatic
         end.</p>

      <p id="comment-120"> <b>Commentary 9: Scenes 1/83-1/84</b></p>




      <p>The scenes filmed on location in Rome constituted the first stage of the 8-month Middlemarch
         shoot, commencing in January 1993. Filming in Rome was

         constrained both by problems with permissions and costs, according to Production Manager,
         Julie Edwards. As a consequence, some of the scenes written in

         the Shooting script (1/80-82) were cut. Scene 1/79 was also edited significantly.
         Originally, it saw the newly-wed Casaubons exiting ‘a beautiful church’

         and Dorothea observing fervently that ‘the Christ-child was so very like a real baby’.
         Davies’ stage directions note: ‘A bit of biology operating there,

         not just art-appreciation. The happy baby, the young woman holding him, the young
         woman looking at the picture’. Such opportunities for visual symbolism,

         Davies records, were part of an effort to make Rome seem ‘shockingly Italian to them…
         all these classical sculptures’ (Davies 1993, p.108).

         In particular, he was keen ‘to see them going past all those great fountains with
         intertwined nymphs on fawns all glossy and gleaming… but we never quite

         got any of that fountain imagery’ (Davies 1993, p.109).</p>




      <p>In the Post-production script some of what might have been lost in potent symbolism
         is made up for in terse dialogue which reinforces both Causabon’s

         efforts to indulge his young wife and their mutual boredom. The museums are altered
         – the Campidoglio becomes the Palazzo Doria Pamphili. And the moment at

         which Casaubon abandons her (for the Capitoline library and to the prurient gaze of
         artistic onlookers), is transformed from ‘some masterpiece’ to ‘a statue

         of Cupid and Venus’ which catches her eye while Casaubon extemporises upon a statue
         of the naked Apollo. In the scene as filmed, Juliet Aubrey actually wanders

         out of frame as he speaks. This is just one example of what Jakob Lothe identifies
         as ‘film’s capacity for ironic presentation’ (2006, p.189) which mimics

         authorial commentary by implicitly belitting Casaubon. Yet in the novel, Dorothea
         encounters these works alone or ‘with Tantripp and their experienced courier’

         (Ch.19, p.295).</p>




      <p>The short Chapter 19 sets the scene in Rome, foregrounds the importance of the burgeoning
         German Romanticism and its infusion of Rome’s classical iconography

         with the potency of personal epiphany, and stages Naumann and Ladislaw’s discovery
         of ‘a breathing, blooming girl, whose form, not shamed by the Ariadne, was

         clad in Quakerish grey drapery’ (Ch.19, p. 288). In the adaptation she becomes, for
         Naumann, the Madonna, and is dressed appropriately in blue, with a distinct

         halo effect created by the lining of her hat brim. This is invention, but certainly
         a more obvious icon for a late twentieth-century audience. Whilst in the novel

         Naumann interprets her ‘as a sort of Christian Antigone’ (Ch.19, p.290) informed by
         the pagan associations of Ariadne/Cleopatra, the costume designer, Anushia

         Nieradzik, achieves in Aubrey’s hat something of ‘the white beaver bonnet which made
         a sort of halo to her face around the simply braided dark-brown hair’

         (Ch.19, p.288).</p>




      <p>The couple’s estrangement is described further in Chapter 20 when, two hours after
         being discovered by Naumann and Ladislaw, Dorothea is back at her apartment

         ‘sobbing bitterly’ (Ch.20, p.294). Exposure to the art treasures of Rome has had a
         profound effect: ‘Forms both pale and glowing took possession of her young sense’


         (Ch.20, pp.296-7). And, reflecting on her married state, she finds herself ‘in an
         interval when the very force of her nature heightened its confusion’ (Ch.20, p.298).


         Casaubon’s failed efforts to entertain his wife in Rome, their first argument about
         his work, and those events leading up to her discovery by Naumann and Ladislaw are


         then related by Eliot as a sort of narrative flashback to complete Chapter 20, which
         concludes:</p>




      <p>She did not really see the streak of sunlight on the floor more than she saw the statues:
         she was inwardly seeing the light of years to come in her own home and

         over the English fields and elms and hedge-bordered highroads; and feeling that the
         way in which they might be filled with joyful devotedness was not so clear

         to her as it had been (Ch.20, p. 311).</p>

      <p id="comment-150"> <b>Commentary 10: Scene 2/1</b></p>




      <p>Originally conceived as the opening to Episode 2, scene 2/1 in the Post-production
         script - depicting the dedication of the new Fever Hospital – is

         positioned between the intense, early revelatory scenes of Dorothea and Casaubon’s
         honeymoon in Rome and those that follow the couple to Naumann’s studio.

         Had it remained the opening scene, 2/1 might have appeared as a none-too-subtle recap
         for the television audience of key figures and issues in bustling

         Middlemarch. Situated as it finally was, this scene presents the sunny optimism of
         a town that is expanding and looking to provide better amenities for its

         residents, as opposed to the darker preceding scenes of emotional repression and frustration
         in Rome.</p>




      <p>Another of Davies’ pure inventions for the adaptation – this scene brings together
         several social strata from Town and Country. These range from the

         landed Lord and Lady Medlicote (only ever mentioned in passing in the novel) to Bulstrode
         the banker and financier of the hospital, Mr Vincy the ribbon

         manufacturer presiding as mayor, the Vincy ladies, Brooke and Dr Lydgate down to Farebrother
         (the rejected former chaplain) and the coarse lawyer and

         town clerk Hawley. Davies involves many of these in the dialogue to remind viewers
         of the context of social reform, Lydgate’s status as medical officer

         and Tyke’s chaplaincy at the new hospital. The mise-en-scène is carefully framed so
         that the crowd outside the Stamford residence used for this scene

         (Barn Hill House) appears larger than it was on the location set. Several carriages
         are drawn up front-right, and the left-hand side is taken up by the

         raised dias from which Vincy delivers his welcoming speech. Behind him, acting as
         a surtitle for the whole scene and a reminder of its location, is a

         banner-like backdrop on which Production designer, Gerry Scott produced lettering
         that reads ‘Middlemarch Fever Hospital’.</p>




      <p>The pervading atmosphere at the start of the scene is aspirational. One camera shot
         with Lydgate in the foreground (‘prominent…handsome and confident’

         SS p.2/1) and the Medlicotes standing above him (‘patrician and toffee nosed, SS p.2/1),
         frames them all looking up at Vincy. He basks in the honour of his

         mayoral duties, while Mrs Vincy observes with pride and, when he mentions Lydgate’s
         name, Rosamond thinks ‘my hero’. This atmosphere changes with the input

         of two hecklers: Brooke with his benign but amusingly persistent vocal support for
         reform and Hawley with his more aggravated grumblings about Tyke’s recent

         appointment as chaplain. The latter reminds the audience that although everything
         looks bright for Lydgate in this scene, at the end of Episode 1 he compromised

         his principles by voting for Tyke and siding with Bulstrode.</p>




      <p>The number of interjections by Brooke increases between the Shooting script and the
         Post-production script showing his lack of delicacy - undermining Vincy’s

         authority over the dedication ceremony and reminding the viewer of his intentions
         to venture into local politics. While Brooke brings a comic element to the scene

         embarrassing himself by wittering away as Lady Medlicote goes to unveil the plaque,
         these interruptions also chime with Susie Conklin’s comment that Robert Hardy

         would often lobby both her or director Anthony Page for more lines with suggestions
         like ‘If I said such-and-such, just that line in the book where…” (Conklin

         2022, p.13)</p>




      <p>Scene 2/1 was shot on the morning of 6 July 1993, a sunny day that showed off the
         bright freshly cleaned façade of Barn Hill House, convincingly selling itself

         as a new-build Fever Hospital of 1830. This was part of the boon that Stamford proved
         to be as the location for Middlemarch. Anthony Page reveals that ‘once

         we’d found Stamford …everything else seemed to fall into place… there were big areas
         that weren’t spoiled… I mean big areas that looked like a town lived in

         at that point’ (Page 1993, pp.25-6). This authenticity not only contributes to the
         visual aesthetic of the whole production but also contrasts strongly with

         the purposely dowdy décor of some of the country house settings and the rather forbidding
         and cold antiquity of the honeymoon scenes in Rome which sit either side

         of this sunlit scene in Middlemarch.</p>




      <p>The end of the Shooting script is trimmed from the Post-production script, losing
         the Brooke’s comment to Lydgate that the hospital is ‘the kind of thing’ his

         niece Dorothea ‘wants to see everywhere’, along with Lydgate being buttonholed and
         Bulstrode who asks him to ‘step this way for a moment’. This ending originally

         acted as a link to the wedding journey scenes in Rome that precede 2/1 in the onscreen
         version and so there is no need for the reminder for the audience of Dorothea

         and Casaubon.</p>

      <p id="comment-155"> <b>Commentary 11: Scenes 2/2-2/4</b></p>


      <p>Episode 2 opens in Rome, with Ladislaw sketching outside the Casaubons' apartment,
         then the short, sad bedroom scene (previously scene 1/86)

         and the following morning’s argument (1/87). The visit of

         Ladislaw to Dorothea alone (2/4) and Casaubon’s subsequent jealous rebuke (2/8), are
         divided from the Naumann studio scenes by the Fever Hospital

         opening (2/1). This alteration in sequencing from the Shooting script does not require
         the viewer to recall the cause of Dorothea’s unhappiness from

         the previous episode. In fact, the short scene (2/3) of Dorothea sobbing on her bed,
         interrupted by Tantripp, the maid, presenting Ladislaw’s calling

         card, is omitted from the final production altogether. This is significant, since
         the corresponding Chapter 20 in the novel uses Dorothea’s solitary

         tears as a bridging device, whose cause is then explained as the argument with Casaubon,
         following which they go ahead with a planned visit the

         museum where Naumann and Ladislaw observe Dorothea – a scene which has been established
         first in Chapter 19. Chapter 21 begins by explaining ‘It was

         in that way Dorothea came to be sobbing as soon as she was securely alone’ (Ch.21,
         p.312). This passage of non-sequential narration, involving an effective

         ‘flashback’, not only interiorises Dorothea’s unhappiness, but structures her experience
         in Rome melodramatically, as a sort of emotional maelstrom

         in which cause and effect are in turmoil.</p>




      <p>Andrew Davies reorders events: the argument takes place on the morning following their
         visit to the museum and is preceded by the invented night

         scenes (1/85-6). And he elides Dorothea’s private grief altogether. So when Ladislaw
         calls on her, the screenwriter originally suggested, ‘I think

         we might start with silence. He fancies her even more than when he first saw her,
         and is intrigued to see she’s been crying’ (Shooting script, 2/4).

         This echoes the novel precisely: ‘The signs of girlish sorrow in her face were only
         the more striking’ (Ch.21, p.313), but this was cut. Indeed, the

         Post-production script eschews fulsome stage directions and the exchanges are more
         matter-of-fact, suppressing the feelings of both characters.

         They are physically remote in the spacious apartment and Ladislaw remains standing
         despite Dorothea asking him to sit down. In the Shooting script

         they are both seated throughout this scene, implying greater intimacy. And although
         Ladislaw’s criticism of Casaubon pains her, it also convinces

         her. She ends: ‘Oh, how I wish I had learnt German when I was at Lausanne! Then I
         could have been of use! Oh, poor, poor Edward!’ In the novel

         Dorothea invites Ladislaw to dine with them; some of her responses to art are transposed
         to scene 2/11 (for example, ‘in Rome it seems as if there were so

         many things which are more wanted in the world than pictures’ (Ch.21, p.317)); finally,
         Casaubon returns before Will’s departure. The clandestine, though

         more restrained, nature of their encounter is thus emphasised more strongly in the
         adaptation, and is reinforced by Casaubon’s clear disapproval

         at its discovery in scene 2/8: ‘You received him in my absence?’.</p>



      <p>In between, the cause of his own pent-up frustration is revealed in scene 2/5. Here,
         as Jakob Lothe notes, Davies employs Dorothea’s voice-over as

         an antagonism which haunts the despondent Casaubon alone amidst his books in the Vatican
         library, serving to condemn his fruitless labours: ‘Because her

         voice is audible as voice-over only, it acquires a narrative authority comparable
         to that of the novel’s third-person narrator, Lothe suggests (2006,

         p.189). This is a significant change from the same scene in the Shooting script where
         a stage direction indicates, ‘we start hearing whispers in Latin

         and Hebrew and English and contemptuous German - not clear, overlapping, defying sense
         and pattern, and the paper [before him] blurs, and he claps his

         hands over his ears and hunches over his desk with his hands over his head as if protecting
         himself from a rain of blows’. This interior soundscape is

         one non-realist technique Davies originally intended using more widely (amongst Middlemarch
         gossipers for example), but which wasn’t adopted (see Davies

         1993, pp.104-5).</p>

      <p id="comment-160"> <b>Commentary 12: Scene 2/9-2/12</b></p>




      <p>Chapter 22 of the novel begins ‘Will Ladislaw was delightfully agreeable at dinner
         the next day, and gave no opportunity for Mr Casaubon to show

         disapprobation’ (p.324). This not only reassures Dorothea, but encourages Casaubon
         to accept cordially his young cousin’s direct invitation to visit

         the artists’ studios, as ‘his labours in the Library would be suspended for a couple
         of days’ (p.325).</p>




      <p>In scene 2/8, the discovery of Ladislaw’s visit in his absence adds jealousy to the
         self-doubts Casaubon has experienced at the library. Yet he

         acquiesces to Dorothea’s report of Will’s invitation to visit some of ‘the religious
         painters here’. There follows her entreaty for forgiveness (for their

         argument that morning), and his meagre repost: ‘who with repentance is not satisfied,
         is not of heaven nor earth.’ In such a short exchange this range of

         emotional colours requires dexterity from the actors since both characters are suffering
         inner turmoil. Recalling the significant omission of Dorothea’s

         tears from the final production, the scene’s concluding stage directions differ somewhat:
         ‘It's so much less than she hoped for, it's all she can do not

         to sob her heart out for the second time in a day’ (SS, p.2/14); ‘His uneasy little
         smile, he's terrified of intimacy. She is clearly upset’ (PP, p.2/14).

         Once more, Dorothea’s emotional temperature is dialled down in the drama as screened,
         while Casaubon is required to express much from very little. What we

         lose from the novel’s dinner scene is Ladislaw’s exploitation of the couple’s disharmony
         for his own desires.</p>




      <p>&gt;Casaubon’s austerity is punished with mockery, however, at Naumann’s studio. Dramatic
         irony is the order of the day, in novel and screenplay alike.

         Yet it is staged differently in each. The whole episode in the novel occupies Chapter
         22 which comprises four scenes: Will dining at the Casaubons’ apartment,

         their both sitting for Naumann at his studio, Ladislaw and Naumann’s reflections on
         the day the same evening, and Ladislaw’s subsequent visit to Dorothea

         alone. Andrew Davies skilfully conflates these separate elements into a series of
         staged vignettes achieved through theatrical juxtaposition and cinematic

         elision.</p>




      <p>To begin with, the understanding between Ladislaw and Naumann is altered slightly.
         In the novel Naumann is a precocious and manipulative flatterer who

         easily gains the confidence of the Casaubons, much to Ladislaw’s indignance: ‘All
         this was impudence and desecration, and he repented that he had brought

         her’ (Ch.22, p.331). The narrator confides: ‘I will not dwell on Naumann's jokes at
         the expense of Mr Casaubon that evening, or on his dithyrambs about

         Dorothea's charm, in all which Will joined, but with a difference… Will got exasperated
         at his presumption: there was grossness in his choice of the most

         ordinary words, and what business had he to talk of her lips? She was not a woman
         to be spoken of as other women were’ (Ch.22, p.332). Yet Andrew Davies

         grants Ladislaw greater agency in this elaborate charade: Naumann ‘catches the eye
         of Ladislaw, who has arranged all this to his own satisfaction’ (SS, p.2/16).

         And he reduces Will’s thinly-veiled adoration of Dorothea, into something more like
         cool detachment. Indeed, it is Ladislaw who, while Naumann detains Casaubon

         to sit for him, engineers Dorothea’s removal to the balcony where he can talk to her
         alone.</p>




      <p>The focus thence moves back and forth between the artist’s studio interior and the
         balcony in Chekovian manner, scene 2/11 being split in two in the

         Post-production script. Will and Dorothea talk more about the art of Rome (lifted
         from Chapter 21), she seeks his opinion on the cameos bought for Celia,

         and she reconfirms her anxiety about Will’s critique of her husband’s work (taken
         from Will’s second visit to Dorothea’s apartment in the final scene of

         Chapter 22). What these exchanges achieve in economy and compression, they lose in
         feeling with regard to Dorothea’s palpable distress as her faith in her

         husband begins to falter, and to Ladislaw’s romantic frustration (trying to win her
         affection by attacking Casaubon).</p>




      <p>Finally, while in the novel both Dorothea and Casaubon agree to sit for Naumann openly
         – she as St. Clara  ̶  the screenplay pulls off a beautiful visual

         joke which only film can achieve. For while sketching Casaubon’s head for St. Thomas
         Aquinas – posing with a skull - Naumann is also capturing Dorothea’s

         portrait unawares. As Lothe notes, ‘This exposure of Casaubon’s ignorance is an illustrative
         example of film’s capacity for ironic presentation: left in

         the dark by Naumann, whose real interest is in Dorothea, Casaubon fails to see that
         while being sketched he is actually being mocked. Responding to a

         significant feature of the literary text, the adaptation elegantly displays the contrast
         between seeing in a purely literal sense and seeing what is going

         on in a much larger sense. Casaubon fails on both counts’ (2006, p.189). And this
         is a fitting substitute for Eliot’s sardonic narration.</p>

      <p id="comment-165"> <b>Commentary 13: Scenes 2/20-21A and 2/37</b></p>




      <p>A pair of scenes in the first half of Episode 2, exemplify several of Andrew Davies’
         core adaptive techniques with extraordinary economy. Both focalise

         Mary Garth whom the audience first meets in scene 1/27 at Stone Court and whose measured
         affection for Fred Vincy is revealed there. But in scenes

         2/20-21A and scene 2/37, Davies depicts visits from the rival suitors for Mary’s hand
         – Fred Vincy and Rev Farebrother. These parallel scenes both

         take place in the hallway at Stone Court as Mary snatches time with each of them between
         caring for old Peter Featherstone.</p>




      <p>Davies takes two incidents from Chapter 25 of the novel and conflates them to make
         scenes 2/20-21A where Mary ruefully counts out the money she must

         sacrifice from her savings to pay the balance of Fred’s debt, which her father has
         underwritten and Fred has failed to repay, and then upbraids him about

         his unthinking behaviour. In the novel Fred visits to confess his shame to Mary about
         this conduct and afterwards Caleb Garth arrives to collect the money

         for the debt.</p>




      <p>By contrast scene 2/37, where Farebrother visits Mary ostensibly to let her know that
         Fred is now recovering from typhoid, is entirely of Davies’

         invention. In Chapter 31, Fred instead goes to stay at Stone Court to recuperate from
         his illness, accompanied by Mrs Vincy who wishes to avoid

         Mary and Fred spending too much time together unchaperoned.</p>




      <p>The fact that both scenes take place in a liminal location at Stone Court (Hall, SS,
         p.2/36; ‘Stairs/hall’, SS, p.2/60) is the screenwriter’s means

         of showing that Mary’s role is rather unusual in the household, being neither a servant
         nor a family member. So, if she has spare time, she sits in the

         hallway, primed to be at Featherstone’s beck and call. In the novel Fred finds her
         reading in the ‘wainscoted parlour’ (Ch.25, p.254). In the adaptation,

         at the end of their talk, Featherstone shouts for her to come upstairs, wondering
         ‘What the devil are you at, girl?’ Similarly at the start of scene 2/37,

         Mary is hurrying downstairs with a tray from Featherstone’s chamber and can only stop
         to speak with Farebrother because the old man has refused to see

         the reverend. Production manager Julie Edwards’ interview reveals that the location
         for Stone Court (Stragglethorpe Hall, 12 miles south of Lincoln) was a

         private residence and so only a reception room (‘The parlour, a big room with a low
         ceiling, dim because of the small windows’, SS, p.1/46) and a bedroom

         (‘Featherstone’s bedroom’, SS, p.1/89 et alia) would have been available for shooting
         (Edwards 2022, p.21). It is unlikely then that Mary could

         have been visited in the kitchen for example, or that there was a ‘wainscoted’ parlour.
         This hallway is also a public space where it would have been more

         conventionally acceptable in a Victorian setting for Mary to pass the time with a
         visiting bachelor.</p>




      <p>In fact, Mary’s conversations with both Fred and Farebrother concern highly personal
         matters. Fred is at pains to gain Mary’s assurance that she does

         not hate him for placing her family under financial pressure. Mary’s balanced response,
         that on the one hand she ‘could never hate’ him, but on the

         other his behaviour means she could never respect him and she can never marry a man
         she does not respect, supports A G Bradley’s assertion that the

         Garth family lie at the moral centre of the narrative, representing Eliot’s ‘locus
         for values’ (1975, p.49) in the novel. Mary, unlike all the other

         the youthful protagonists, has received solid, responsible and sustained parenting
         and this is reflected in her own attitudes. In his interview for the

         <em>Screening Middlemarch</em> study pack, Davies admits that the character of Mary ‘always rather got up my nose’
         (Davies 1993, p.117)

         and he found ‘writing’ her a challenge. In shaping her dialogue, he attempted to create
         ‘a kind of subtext’ running beneath her statements to Fred that

         ‘I won’t speak to you, I won’t see you, I won’t marry you until you reform’, that
         said plaintively but ‘I love you, I love you’. He was only sure that this

         had worked when he witnessed Rachel Power’s sincere interpretation of the part which
         meant ‘you don’t think she’s all goody, goody, you just think… what a

         lovely person, I hope it all goes right for her’ (Davies 1993, p.118).</p>




      <p>The empathy for Mary that grows in the audience matches her sympathy for both Fred
         and for Farebrother. In scene 2/37, Davies makes her quick to reassure

         the reverend with ‘You know I have’ when he asks if she has time to spare him. Power’s
         Mary is also more knowing than Davies’ final stage direction assumes.

         This maintains of Farebrother’s arch comment that he bests Fred in every game ‘Except
         one, perhaps’ and that Mary does not think of him as a suitor ‘so that

         he can make a remark like that without her getting it’ (SS, p.2/61). Yet Power’s wistful
         and sympathetic direct gaze begs to differ. It leaves the audience

         wondering if Camden Farebrother might yet have chance with her, and demonstrates that
         her shrewd understanding of Fred’s errant nature extends to her mature

         responses to other men.</p>




      <p>Mary’s theme music is also representative of her identity.  As composer Chris Gunning
         explains: a ‘recorder plays the tune’ poignantly ‘accompanied by

         a little string orchestra’ that speaks of a pastoral tradition and of honesty (Gunning
         1993, p.19). In terms of the architecture of the episode,

         Davies brackets this pair of scenes around some significant plot lines, including
         the Casaubons’ return from Rome, and scene 2/21A heralding the onset of

         Fred’s illness (depicted onscreen by his pale and perspiring face) while scene 2/37
         brings Mary news of his recovery. The bookending effect of these two

         hallway scenes is successful in introducing the lengthy negotiation that will take
         place over Mary’s hand, and their almost identical staging invites the

         viewer to compare and contrast her options.</p>

      <p id="comment-170"> <b>Commentary 14: Scene 2/45</b></p>


      <p>Scene 2/45 of Episode 2 depicts a meeting between Bulstrode and Lydgate outside the
         hospital. Walking through the streets of Middlemarch, Bulstrode questions

         the doctor’s intentions towards his niece, Rosamond. When Lydgate professes surprise
         at the question and answers nothing more than a ‘pleasant acquaintanceship’,

         Bulstrode advises him to moderate his attentions so that Rosamond’s other suitors
         have a chance of winning her affection.  </p>




      <p>This exchange is noteworthy because, although the scene is an invention of Davies’,
         it clearly coalesces existing strands within the novel including the gossip

         circulating about Lydgate and Rosamond, Mrs Bulstrode’s opposition to the union and
         Mr Bulstrode and Lydgate’s own murky relationship. Indeed, Bulstrode’s remarks

         echo closely that of his wife’s in the novel when she reminds Lydgate that his presence
         in Rosamond’s life ‘militate very much against a girl’s making a desirable

         settlement in life and prevent her from accepting offers even if they are made’ (Ch.31,
         p.39). In the novel as in the television series, Lydgate is annoyed (‘fuming’

         (Ch.31, p. 40)) by the Bulstrodes’ comments but Davies’ swap of Harriet for Nicholas
         lends the exchange a distinctly different tenor. While for Davies, Harriet is

         ‘kindly but inexorable’, her husband is repeatedly described as ‘sinister’ (2/44)
         and the tones of their dialogue with Lydgate are appropriately distinct. Although


         Mrs Bulstrode’s actions in the novel, which have an ‘unmistakable purpose of warning,
         if not of rebuke’ (Ch.31, p.39), seem intended to protect her niece, there is a

         deliberately ominous note to Mr Bulstrode’s cautions in the television series.</p>




      <p>The question remains, then, why attribute Harriet Bulstrode’s interventions to her
         husband when her opposition to the union is already apparent in 2/44 in counselling


         Rosamond that she is in ‘no position to marry a poor man’? Adaptive economy may be
         one answer. A conversation between Mr Bulstrode and Lydgate could require less narrative


         contrivance because it can be occasioned by their joint venture: the hospital. The
         ‘walk-and-talk’ structure also offers an exterior sequence which breaks up a run of


         indoor scenes and reinforces the sense of place. By comparison, in the novel Lydgate
         and Mrs Bulstrode talk at a party and Episode 2 already depicts one such social gathering.</p>




      <p>But more than this, it is expedient to maintain Mr Bulstrode’s narrative importance
         at this relatively early point in the series. Doing so helps seed his later downfall,


         while still conveying a sense of the couple’s connection to the rest of Middlemarch;
         a connection that is, of course, placed under great strain by the novel’s end and


         eventually broken. Davies’ edits between the Shooting script and the Post-production
         script certainly demonstrate the importance of framing this moment to serve both Bulstrode’s


         character arc and Lydgate’s. The Post-production script cuts the conversation to end
         on Bulstrode’s unsettling comment that he hoped Lydgate would ‘avoid a painful misunderstanding’


         rather than the Shooting script’s more convivial, ‘Thank you, Dr. Lydgate. I am grateful
         to you’.</p>




      <p>Davies’ adaptation emphasises the unsavoury nature of Bulstrode’s relationship with
         Lydgate, via a Chorus-like group of gossips who gather in the background during the


         climax of the scene. Their scrutiny combines palpably with Bulstrode’s menacing reminder
         that Lydgate is obligated to him (‘I have already been of some assistance to you?’).


         Douglas Hodge looks intensely discomfited and Peter Jeffrey, as appropriately and
         quietly sinister as Davies imagined.</p>




      <p>The novel, of course, makes it similarly clear that Lydgate attracts speculation.
         The narrator wryly informs us that it is no more possible to find ‘social isolation’


         in Middlemarch ‘than elsewhere’ and Lydgate’s ‘agreeable holiday freedom’ (Ch.31,
         p.32) inevitably falters against the community’s effective gossip networks. Eliot’s


         expansive writing allows her to move from individual to individual so that we gain
         new angles on the Bulstrodes and Lydgate in turn and steadily realises the way his


         flirtation has been promulgated through ‘innuendo’ (Ch.31, p.40) by characters like
         Mrs Plymdale or Mr Farebrother. Davies encountered difficulties adapting this fairly


         ephemeral quality of the novel, however. He explained that while he employed some
         non-realist devices like voiceovers for memories, he was not supported in developing
         more

         ‘stylistic’ concepts like an embodied sense of gossip as a Chorus of ‘overlapping
         voices’ that created a ‘sense of […] malevolent deadening’ (Davies 1993, p.104).

         For Davies, gossip is inherently malevolent; the examples he offers of the kind of
         murmurings one would hear include ‘nothing came of him’; ‘stuck up’ and a threatening,


         ‘bring em down to our level’ (Davies 1993 p.105).</p>




      <p>The series’ depiction of Middlemarch as a town of swirling gossip is perhaps less
         stylistically radical than Davies might have hoped, but arguably no less pervasive


         within the realist terms set by the novel and echoed in the adaptation. The gossiping
         women who stand between Lydgate and Bulstrode, for example, are an effective

         visual metaphor for the way both men are hostage to the court of public opinion in
         Middlemarch. Davies’ shift from wife to husband therefore foreshadows the cost of


         Lydgate’s entanglement with both the Vincys and the Bulstrodes, at a moment when —
         ironically — he disavows the possibility of marriage. By creating a new and, importantly,


         public opportunity for gossip, Davies simultaneously makes Rosamond’s and Lydgate’s
         eventual union even more inexplicable, <em>and</em> he ensures that the audience

         are increasingly aware of the stakes of joining this family.</p>

      <p id="comment-175"> <b>Commentary 15: Scenes 2/48-2/51</b></p>




      <p>The sequence of scenes at Lowick (scenes 2/46-2/51), following the Casaubons’ return
         from Rome which culminate in Rev Casaubon’s first seizure, are a model

         of Andrew Davies’ adaptive economy and concision. Whilst the key scenes - the couple’s
         argument occasioned by the receipt of Ladislaw’s letters and the seizure

         itself (scenes 2/49-2/51) - are themselves dramatised in dialogue in the novel, much
         of the rest of what Davies animates here is filleted from longer descriptive

         passages in the source. And there is another significance difference. In the novel
         Celia and Chettam are frequent visitors and are on hand shortly after Casaubon’s

         collapse; in Davies’ script Dorothea is isolated and deals with the incident alone.</p>




      <p>This commentary will commence with scene 2/48 as Dorothea descends the main wooden
         staircase at Lowick, her leaden footsteps sounding on the bare boards. The

         stairway is illuminated by shafts of light through the windows above, suggesting the
         bright world outside this sombre, panelled interior. She is descending

         from the light to the shadowy hallway beneath. She pauses at the stairs’ turn and
         looks apprehensively towards the library door. At the bottom she pauses again,

         looking down to check the copywork she is about to present for her husband’s judgement.
         Her chestnut brown dress causes her figure to be absorbed visually into

         the wood-panelled background; her face alone is illuminated. The end of scene 2/48
         cuts to Casaubon in his study, books and papers on the desk before him,

         looking sideways down and left towards the camera at an open letter at the bottom
         of the frame.  The stage directions indicate only that he is ‘deep in thought’.

         But to this Patrick Malahide adds two significant further gestures in the seven-second
         shot before we cut back to Dorothea’s apprehensive approach to the library

         door: ‘It's an effort to make herself turn the handle and go in.’ He looks up and
         towards the light source (we assume the window), raises his right hand to his

         temple and a pained expression furrows his brow, as if he cannot face the challenge
         the light brings from the outside world.</p>




      <p>It is not difficult (for George Eliot or Andrew Davies) to portray Casaubon’s faults;
         it is much more difficult to elicit our sympathy for him. That series of

         Malahide’s mute expressions of introspection and anxiety must work to convey Casaubon’s
         entire, troubled emotional state as effectively as the previous scene between

         Dorothea and Tantripp has done for his young wife. Director, Anthony Page conveyed
         in interview something of the challenges the production encountered in respect of


         Casaubon’s inner life:</p>




      <p>he was someone who wanted to believe and wanted other people to believe that he was
         a genius and as soon as he let someone into his life that saw that he wasn’t

         his whole support mechanism crumbles because he can’t really kid himself any longer
         and in some ways she kills him. …

         We did have to in the scenes, the scripting and the acting adjust continually to try
         and find a way to express that (Page 1993, p.65).</p>




      <p>Casaubon’s unease on this occasion has both general and particular causes. Generally,
         as Page describes, he has realised that acquiring a helpmate in marriage

         to achieve his scholarly ambitions has backfired, and his wife’s interfering presence
         has become a constant reminder of his own intellectual bankruptcy. This

         situation is compounded by his inability to accommodate any of the other, more conventional
         pleasures of married life. Specifically, his disturbance is figured

         in the spectre of Will Ladislaw, whose letter announcing his intention to return to
         Middlemarch revives his jealousy (from Rome) of this young man’s sway over his

         wife’s affections, and the effect he has had already in undermining Dorothea’s belief
         in her husband’s academic enterprise.</p>




      <p>The scene begins from Casaubon’s perspective with Dorothea venturing a series of proposals
         with the intention of pleasing her husband: returning the finished

         copying, offering to read to him, proposing a walk or a drive, suggesting she helps
         by copying selected passages from his notebooks, enquiring if he has received

         feedback on his article on the Etruscan mysteries. These ventures, of Andrew Davies’
         invention, are each rebuffed brusquely as she moves behind him and we progress

         to a reverse shot of Casaubon (still seated) from his left and Dorothea standing behind
         him at her desk. At this point he holds out (without looking at her) the

         letter to her from Will Ladislaw. The stage directions indicate: ‘He holds it as if
         it's full of germs. But she doesn't notice, getting a letter is a rare event,

         she's quite excited’ (PP, p.2/53). She takes the letter eagerly and sits at her own
         desk to read; they are seated, tellingly, back-to-back.</p>




      <p>The exchange which ensues is taken almost verbatim from the novel – Casaubon’s bitter
         insistence upon protection ‘from guests whose desultory vivacity makes

         their presence a fatigue!!’ and Dorothea’s rapier retorts: ‘Edward, why do you think
         I should wish for anything that would annoy you? When have I ever consulted

         my own pleasure before yours?’ These are framed in intercut eyeline-matched medium
         close-ups of their direct engagement in ferocious battle. For the first time,

         Dorothea gives as good as she gets. Yet the dramatisation preserves sympathy for Dorothea,
         by removing the boldest charge from her speech: ‘You speak to me as

         if I were something you had to contend against’ (Ch.29, p.16). In the adaptation this
         is as self-evident, dramatically, as it is true. The effect on Casaubon,

         in both cases, is shock which he barely contains. Significantly, Davies indicates,
         ‘Only his trembling hands give him away’ (PP 2/54).</p>




      <p>Whilst in the novel Dorothea remains in the library, in the dramatisation she withdraws
         in high dudgeon.‘As she is about to go upstairs, we hear a crash, as

         of a chair falling over. She turns and runs back to the library’ (PP, p.2/55). Here
         the musical score intervenes melodramatically: heavy, pulsing bass strings

         with sweeping cellos striding up and down minor arpeggios. As composer Chris Gunning
         remarked, ‘from episode two onwards, when you see his uncertainty for

         instance in the library, that’s where the really dark colours start up [and] the musical
         colours become darker and darker as he becomes more and more doom-laden’

         (Gunning 1993, p.8). scene 2/51 as shot suggests some different ways were tried in
         rehearsal of presenting Dorothea’s ministrations to her husband, prone against

         the library steps. Dorothea’s line from the Shooting script ‘Edward, what is it my
         love?’ is cut. Then after ‘Lean on me, dear’, she was originally required to take


         ‘his not inconsiderable weight, gets his arm over her shoulder, and half drags, half
         carries him to a couch’.  Onscreen this was jettisoned in favour of her feverish

         fingers (trembling hands again) fumbling to loosen his neckerchief, accompanied by
         some ad lib enquiries as to his state. Another significant line of Davies’ original


         dialogue is cut: ‘Oh, Edward, I'm sorry.’ Whilst her feelings of guilt emerge from
         subsequent scenes, it was surely right to remove from this one such an immediate

         and blunt admission of responsibility.</p>

      <p id="comment-180"> <b>Commentary 16: Scene 2/71</b></p>




      <p>Scene 2/71 forms the climax of Episode 2. After Lydgate attends to the failing Featherstone
         at Stone Court, he agrees to return home for Mrs Vincy in order to fetch her

         husband. Forgetting that Mr Vincy is at the factory, his arrival at the Vincy home
         is announced to a confused and upset Rosamond. Moved by her tears, Lydgate embraces


         Rosamond, kisses her face and admits that he cares for her ‘more than anyone’ before
         declaring, ‘I want you to be my wife.’ The episode fades to black.</p>




      <p>Although the proposal closes the second episode of the series, it was not always so.
         The Shooting script reveals that original plans for the adaptation gave Brooke the
         last

         words. The earlier iteration of the episode ends instead with Brooke’s invitation
         to Ladislaw, delivered partly in voiceover, as he drafts his letter and ‘scribbles
         his final

         salutation and signature in high spirits’ (SS 2/73). Intriguingly, these earlier plans
         for the episode would have neatly bookended what — by the time of the Post-production


         script — becomes an opening focus in this episode on Dorothea and Casaubon’s already
         failing marriage on their honeymoon in Rome. Indeed, as early as 2/8 Davies’ stage
         directions note

         that Casaubon feels ‘jealous and threatened’ by his young cousin and Brooke’s letter
         sets in place a sequence of events that ends with the devastating proscription in
         Casaubon’s

         will. However, while the love triangle between Casaubon, Dorothea and Ladislaw is
         thus clearly important to Davies, his annotations on Shooting script page 2/54, reveal
         his greater

         determination (‘I am sure’) to end the episode on Rosamond and Lydgate’s proposal.
         Interestingly, a similar change occurred in the development of Episode 1 (see Commentary
         8

         . It, too, was originally

         going to end with a focus on Casaubon’s and Dorothea’s relationship but this was changed
         to Lydgate’s vote for Tyke and his first humiliation by the Middlemarchers. This tendency


         perhaps indicates the more readily relatable quality of Lydgate and Rosamond for Davies.
         Davies utilises these two characters — and their relationship with one another — to
         generate

         the kind of dramatic moments needed to encourage viewership across multiple episodes
         and, having achieved this, Dorothea’s story then gains more precedence in the adaptation’s
         later

         ordering of endings.</p>




      <p>Certainly, Davies’ annotations on Shooting script page 2/54 are a snapshot of what
         was clearly an ongoing conversation between him, his script editor and the series’
         producers.

         On the same page as the opening of Brooke’s and Dorothea’s conversation, Davies offers
         another reading of the scene which — he hopes — will allow him to omit the longer


         letter-writing scene. ‘How about this?’ Davies queries emphatically in capital letters.
         Seemingly, Davies got his way. Not only does Brooke’s invitation fall much earlier
         in

         the episode and receive less screen time, but the ending becomes more exclusively
         preoccupied with Lydgate and Rosamond. But if Davies’ influence can be felt here in
         terms of the

         sequencing of events, it is worth using this occasion to reflect also on the adaptive
         agency of the actors.</p>




      <p>As director Anthony Page explains, film acting relies on an actors’ instinct to pursue
         what feels right ‘inside you’ in the moment (BBC). For the proposal scene, this was
         shaped

         by the familiarity and ‘depth’ (McGowan 2022, p.4) between Douglas Hodge and Trevyn
         McDowell who had already been married on screen twice before Middlemarch. Hodge confirms


         productiveness of their reunion, noting that their ‘comfort’ with one another worked
         as a ‘shorthand’ and a quicker route to discovering things about the scene' (Hodge
         quoted in Page

         1993, p.41). Indeed, their familiarity with one another was aided by the shooting
         schedule: Hodge and McDowell performed the proposal on location in Stamford in July
         1993 after

         a number of marriage scenes were shot in the Ealing studios at the start of 1993 and
         viewers can sense an echo of this ‘poignancy’ (McGowan 2022, p.5) in their performances.

         The result was a shared understanding between Hodge and McDowell that the scene should
         feel spontaneous and ‘out of the blue’ yet in character after two episodes’ worth
         of build-up

         (Hodge quoted in Page 1993, p.35). Blocking within the scene helps deliver the actors’
         reading. Hodge shares that while he found the proposal quite stationary in the novel,
         he wanted

         the scene to be ‘energised’ by the physical distance between the two of them and their
         effort to overcome it (Hodge quoted in Page 1993, p.33). As 2/71 begins, Rosamond
         and Lydgate

         both occupy the outer edges of the drawing room, visibly awkward with one another’s
         presence; indeed, when moved to tears, Rosamond turns away from the camera and from
         Lydgate and

         when he moves towards her, she pulls away further to stand by the fireplace.</p>




      <p>A similar hesitance exists within the novel. Lydgate is frozen by ‘embarrassment’
         and rather than speaking to Rosamond with his characteristic ‘playfulness’, he sits
         away from her,

         unable to speak (Ch.31, p.43). It is not until she drops her chainwork, and he retrieves
         it, that there is détente: Lydgate rises and suddenly close to her face realises that
         she

         is no longer under ‘perfect management of self-contented grace’ but ‘helpless quivering’
         (Ch.31, p.43). From this point onwards, Lydgate can ‘now sit near [Rosamond] and speak
         less

         incompletely’ and their newfound physical proximity echoes his realisation that she
         has raised in him a ‘passionate love’ (Ch.31, p.44). The matter is a fait accompli;
         within half an

         hour he leaves the house ‘an engaged man’ (Ch.31, p.44).</p>




      <p>Although perhaps more dynamic than in the novel, proximity marks the ‘release’ point
         in Hodge’s and McDowell’s performance, too. As Rosamond sobs that she is ‘so unhappy’,
         Lydgate

         ‘takes her lovely face between his great big strong tender hands’ (2/71) and embraces
         her. Between kisses Rosamond gets Lydgate to confirm that ‘More than anyone’ he cares
         for her

         and wishes to marry her. Davies’ stage directions note wryly, ‘He’s more or less got
         to propose now, after all this kissing’ (2/71) and there is indeed a similarly foregone
         quality

         to the scene’s ending. With its sweeping music driving the episode to its close and
         a fade to black, the audience is carried away by the romance of it all. Composer Chris
         Gunning

         explains that the scene’s opening, sombre melody in D minor repeats, becoming more
         optimistic and shifting to a major key as Rosamond and Lydgate reconcile. Gunning
         continues that

         the key change allows the final scene to transition to the title music ‘without too
         many bumps’ but importantly, it also leaves the viewer with the impression that ‘everything
         is

         absolutely wonderful in the world’ (Gunning 1993). Indeed, the conflict which Anthony
         Page notes between Lydgate’s ‘compassionate’ and physical attraction to Rosamond and
         ‘wanting to keep independent

         and work on his ideals’ is, for the moment, resolved or perhaps… ignored (Page 1993,
         p.30).</p>

      <p id="comment-185"> <b>Commentary 17: Scenes 3/10-3/11</b></p>




      <p>Episode 3 begins on the night of Peter Featherstone’s death and the drama that unfolds
         when Mary Garth, his only attendant, refuses to burn his second will, at his

         behest. There is further evidence of the violent treatment that Mary receives at Featherstone’s
         hands as he launches his stick at her in frustration. This start is

         significantly different from the Shooting script where the arrival of the Waules’
         carriages at Stone Court signals his decline (Sc 3/5) and Andrew Davies’ handwritten
         annotations
         to p.3/6 indicate that he would prefer to begin with scene 3/1 – Ladislaw being greeted
         by Brooke on his return to Middlemarch accompanied by ‘bright, lively, challenging
         Ladislaw
         music’. The way these ideas eventually coalesced in the onscreen version to offer
         an episode bookended by pivotal deaths (Featherstone’s and Casaubon’s) in the dual
         inheritance plots
         of Middlemarch represents one of the most intriguing of all the structural adaptations
         in the dramatisation.

         Although there is no way of knowing for sure if the ‘Scene 3/1’ that Davies refers
         to is a proposed reinstatement of one of the ‘cut’ scenes noted at the top of SS

         p.3/6, from an earlier iteration of the script, the fact that he names it 3/1 does
         lead to that speculation. Starting with the Waules was clearly not viewed as a strong

         enough narrative hook into Episode 3 either and so scenes 3/5-7 – where the Waules
         argue and are dismissed from the ailing Featherstone’s bedside were taken back to
         the

         latter stages of the Episode 2 Post-production script. There these scenes help to
         chart Featherstone’s more gradual decline.</p>




      <p>Featherstone, the novel’s narrator reveals, has been planning the ‘programme of his
         funeral’ (Ch.32, p.56) for years and is keen to disappoint his relations after

         his death – ‘chuckling over the vexations he could inflict’ on them (Ch.34, p77).
         As Noa Reich argues, he is a ‘manipulative testator with expectant heirs’ (2021,

         p.1) who lives to ‘assimilate relationships to an economic structure of outlays and
         payoffs’ (2021, p.5). This has worked so far with the Waules and with Fred Vincy,


         but close to his death in Chapter 33, Featherstone has not reckoned on the morally
         unshakeable Mary Garth. When she refuses to destroy the will, he utters in disbelief:


         ‘Shan’t I do as I like at the last? I made two wills on purpose’ (p.68). Mary is not
         tempted to take his banknotes and coins as he bids her or to do anything that will


         lay her ‘open to suspicion’ (p.68). Featherstone’s tears that follow this refusal
         are omitted by Davies from the Shooting script but he does include Featherstone’s
         wish

         to ‘do as I like with my own money’. He has planned everything down this last act
         without allowing that infirmity – his ‘livid stagnant presence’ (Ch 34, p.77) might
         prevent

         him from carrying it out. This is a key point in Eliot’s innovation of the Victorian
         inheritance plot, in that with Stone Court going to Rigg, Featherstone believes he
         is

         passing his property to ‘a posthumous extension of himself’ (Reich, 2021, p.10), thus
         preserving the natural order ‘to the perpetual… disappointment of other survivors’


         (Ch.53, p.376). In fact, Rigg immediately sells the property and it is only restored
         to owners of whom Featherstone would have eventually approved when Fred and Mary pay


         their way to owning it. Eliot plots it so that Fred only ‘inherits’ Stone Court when
         he earns it by his own merit. And he has Mary’s actions at Featherstone’s deathbed
         to

         thank for this.</p>




      <p>With the editing out of the line ‘Shan’t I do as I like…?’ between the Shooting script
         and the Post-production script, an important link to Eliot’s inheritance plot is

         lost in the dramatisation, but the way the scene is shot serves to bring out this
         interpretation visually instead. When Mary (Rachel Power) discovers Featherstone (Michael


         Hordern) has died overnight, she glances stonily at his banknotes and gold coins which
         are shown in close-up. Featherstone’s hand still lies upon them but this means nothing


         now. When the camera returns to Power, her look softens as she pities the man for
         whom control over money and therefore his relations was everything. If the crumpled
         bed

         clothes look convincing for a deathbed scene, it is because Horden, himself rather
         infirm during the filming, actually both performed and actually slept in this bed
         at

         Stragglethorpe Hall during the shoot, according to Production manager Julie Edwards
         (Edwards 2022, p.21). Performance, mise-en-scène and visual cues given by

         the camerawork speak louder than any dialogue at this point.</p>




      <p>In the novel, Shooting script and Post-production script time passes rather differently
         around the moment of Featherstone’s death. In Chapter 33, after Mary’s refusal to

         comply with him, she sits back in her chair but does not doze off. She listens until
         she ‘thought he was dropping off to sleep’ but then on approaching the bed finds his


         face ‘looks strangely motionless’. Andrew Davies adapts this so that responsibility
         for knowing when Featherstone expires is removed from Mary. She is asleep when it
         happens

         and it is daylight before she wakes and opens the curtains to find him dead. (This
         pattern recurs at the end of Episode 3 when Dorothea refuses to answer Casaubon’s
         will-related

         demand in the night and when woken by Trantripp in the early morning, finds her husband
         dead in in the garden at Lowick.) In the onscreen version an establishing shot of


         Stone Court in the early morning light is inserted before scene 3/11 to emphasise
         the passing of several hours before Mary makes her discovery. In the dramatisation,
         she takes

         time to look upon Featherstone, take his hand and bid him a forgiving farewell. In
         the novel, Mary spares less time: ‘she rang to the bell and rang it energetically.
         In a very

         little while there was no longer any doubt that Peter Featherstone was dead’ (Ch.33,
         p.72).</p>

      <p id="comment-190"> <b>Commentary 18: Scene 3/25</b></p>




      <p>The wedding of Rosamond and Lydgate (scene 3/25) is another tour-de-force ensemble
         scene of Andrew Davies’ invention, succinctly delivered in just 1 minute and 45 seconds.


         In parallel to scene 1/64, which charts the reaction of several social strata to Dorothea’s
         engagement to Casaubon, this scene depicts the reaction of Lydgate’s marriage

         to Rosamond from several lower social strata. Notably, Eliot does not directly depict
         either of the weddings of her protagonists. Her interest is not in the ‘show’ of a


         wedding itself but more importantly, as Cara Weber maintains, in opposing ‘the moments
         of contact in courtship - "brief entrances and exits"- to the "continuity of married


         companionship [Ch.20]”’ (Weber 2012, p.500). However, for the screenwriter of a heritage
         costume drama, a wedding is a visual gift and, Davies appreciates, part of the narrative

         attraction for his audience. Davies utilises this wedding scene both to achieve a
         visual treat and to bring together elements of the town’s commentary on the event
         which Eliot

         provides as part of her portrayal of the Middlemarch web that closes more rapidly
         around Lydgate from this moment onwards.</p>




      <p>The pealing of joyful church bells provides an audio transition between the romantic
         kiss exchanged between the impetuously engaged Rosamond and Lydgate at the end of


         scene 3/24 and the shots of them as newly marrieds, emerging with their guests into
         the sunlit churchyard. The overhead shot of this scene and Farebrother’s ‘Congratulations!’


         to the happy couple perfectly depicts Davies’ wish in the Shooting script stage directions
         that it would be



         'nice to have the wedding at the central church in town (possibly Farebrother's church,
         St. Boltoph's) with a large crowd of SPECTATORS watching and commenting'

         (SS 3/25, p.37).



         The Production schedule indicates the scene was shot on 2nd August 1993, in high summer,
         and that the location was St George’s Church in the very heart of Stamford, with its


         neatly walled churchyard. The wall works as a visual symbol in the blocking of the
         scene distinguishing between invited guests (inside) and those townsfolk who are bystanders.</p>




      <p>From the happy couple, the camera cuts to Mrs Dollop and Mrs Flett standing outside
         the wall. In the Shooting script, it is Mrs Flett who expresses intense suspicion
         of

         Lydgate for having been found ready to cut up Mrs Goby shortly after her demise. This
         speech is reallocated to Mrs Dollop in the Post-production script, probably to reflect


         the fact that later in the novel it is she who shares this opinion with her customers
         at The Tankard. As landlady of this ‘spit and sawdust’ inn in Middlemarch, ‘her opinion


         was a bulwark’ (Ch.45, p.256). The role of Mrs Flett (a Davies-invented character)
         in 3/25 is as foil for Mrs Dollop, responding to her, ‘handsome is as handsome does’;
         time,

         these two believe, will tell just how ‘handsome’ Lydgate and Rosamond turn out to
         be.</p>




      <p>The Middlemarch suspicion of ‘otherness’ continues strongly through the remainder
         of this scene. Back inside the churchyard, the camera follows Mrs Vincy as she ad
         libs a

         line inviting Bulstrode to congratulate his niece. The camera comes to rest however
         on his wife and Mrs Plymdale to eavesdrop on their reactions (derived from Ch.31,
         p.34).

         Davies extracts the dialogue from Eliot, including Mrs Plymdale’s view that her ‘Ned’
         could better ‘keep such a wife’. Her dislike of ‘strangers’ like Lydgate is met with


         Mrs Bulstrode’s bible teaching that ‘we are told to entertain strangers, are we not?’,
         and references to ‘Abraham and Moses’. Just how closely Davies followed the novel
         is

         demonstrated by the loss from the Post-production script of Mrs Bulstrode’s line in
         the Shooting script contradicting her friend ‘Selina’ (Mrs Plymdale) about welcoming


         strangers. Selina’s response, that she was not talking ‘in a religious sense, Harriet’
         (PP 3/25, p.3/28), is retained however.</p>




      <p>To break up the town’s commentary on the wedding, the scene shifts to Brooke and Ladislaw
         as they leave through the church gate. The focus of the Middlemarch rumour machine


         thus moves to them, as they greet Hawley and Standish standing just beyond the gate.
         Although Hawley begins by commenting that Vincy will have had to ‘dig deep in his
         pocket

         for this palaver’ (SS 3/25, p.38), the two lawyers move swiftly on to criticise Brooke
         snidely for his political ambitions. This conversation is extracted by Davies from


         Chapter 37, where it takes place in Hawley’s office with Mr Hackbutt (a minor character
         who does not appear in the dramatisation). There Brooke’s new editor is described
         by

         Hackbutt as reputedly being a ‘very brilliant young fellow’; here, in the Post-production
         script, Hawley disparagingly terms Ladislaw ‘a loose fish’ (a rascal who has thrown


         off moral restraint) who is mostly likely to end up ‘murdering a wench’ (Ch.37, p.129).
         In the novel Hackbutt refers to Ladislaw as being of ‘foreign extraction’, whereas
         Hawley

         demeans him as ‘some sort of foreigner’ in the Shooting script, with the same prejudice
         that Mrs Dollop and Mrs Plymdale expressed seconds before about Lydgate. Davies displays


         the parochial attitudes of the middle and lower classes towards outsiders and new
         ideas with swingeing clarity and sharp comparisons in this scene.</p>




      <p>As if immediately to emphasise this, the lawyers’ conversation is interrupted as the
         camera switches to the smiling Ladislaw and Brooke bidding goodbye as they get into


         Brooke’s carriage. Ladislaw’s distinctive hat – that of the Polish emigré – offers
         a strong visual reminder that he is indeed not from the environs of Middlemarch, just


         as much as Brooke’s top hat marks him out as being from the lower English aristocracy.
         They, like Lydgate, may be naively unaware that they have been the subjects of a verbal


         assassination on such a joyful occasion but Davies’ audience certainly is.</p>

      <hr>






      <p id="comment-195"> <b>Commentary 19: Scene 3/32</b></p>


      <p>Subsequent to their first meetings in Rome, there are four scenes in the adaptation
         in which Dorothea is alone with Ladislaw before their ultimate union is

         confirmed in scene 6/84. Two of these (3/32 and 4/43) feature Ladislaw visiting Dorothea
         at home at Lowick, the first of which announces his determination

         to stay in Middlemarch (‘for the time being, I think. There is work for me to do here.’)
         and the second his intention to leave: (‘I intend to go to London

         and study for the Bar’). In neat symmetry, the second and fourth occasions (3/49 and
         5/31) take place at Tipton when Dorothea discovers Will there (apparently

         by chance).</p>




      <p>Despite their repetitive scenario, these scenes are important dramatic staging posts
         in the unfolding melodrama of their thwarted relationship. On each occasion,

         neither is able to declare their feelings for the other openly and, paradoxically
         it seems, this becomes increasingly more difficult. For this reason, as much

         depends on what they don’t say to one another (and what the actors, lighting, mise-en-scène
         and music convey non-verbally), as the lines they speak. From a

         performance perspective this challenge - to deliver in the correct emotional calibration
         the rising temperature of their feelings for one another – was made more

         difficult by a shooting schedule that required Juliet Aubrey and Rufus Sewell to stage
         these scenes in reverse order.  According to the Production schedule,

         scene 3/32 was filmed on the very last day of shooting (at Brymton d’Evercy near Yeovil
         in Somerset), on Thursday 26th August 1993, months after the (later) Tipton

         Grange scene which was shot in Spring 1993 at Culverthorpe Hall, Lincolnshire. This
         discontinuity, as director Anthony Page admitted in interview, was far from ideal


         and had implications for the actors in this case:</p>




      <p>There are several scenes … I wish we’d shot after scenes that had come before.

         Strangely enough more actually with Dorothea and Ladislaw than with the

         Lydgates. Because a scene we shot right at the end of filming, they got very

         friendly and relaxed with each other in a way that’s obviously very important

         to the relationship and other scenes we’d shot earlier didn’t have

         that feeling of relaxation that they discovered, they were much more kind of formal
         with

         each other and I mean you know it’s always better to shoot in sequence if you

         can. (Page 1993, p.39)</p>




      <p>Page is contrasting here Aubrey and Sewell’s chemistry between scenes 3/32 and 5/31.
         This is borne out in close analysis of their performances.</p>




      <p>In scene 3/31 of the Shooting script Andrew Davies stages a formal introduction which
         is missing from the novel and the Post-production script alike.

         But in both versions of the script there is a hiatus which enables us to ‘drop in’
         on a conversation already begun. This is entirely in keeping with the

         novel’s past-continuous tense: ‘In another minute he was in the library, and Dorothea
         was meeting him with her sweet unconstrained smile’ (p.135). The

         Shooting script covers this with a brief scene (3/30) looking through the rain-drenched
         windows to where ‘we can dimly see the distorted shapes of Ladislaw

         and Dorothea inside, on the window seat in the library’ (SS, p.3/46). This eavesdropping
         on their intimacy, like the rain itself, didn’t make the final cut.

         Similarly, the implication that, ‘They’ve been talking for a while’ and ‘the atmosphere
         is quite intimate’ is not how the scene starts in the dramatisation.

         Rather, they begin the scene standing, Dorothea drawing Ladislaw towards the window
         from which the library’s habitually studied gloom is bathed in warm sunlight.

         We are attracted both by the freedom of her movements within her husband’s strict
         domain, tidying sheaves of papers on each desk, and the ease of their reunion.</p>




      <p>A hand-written note by Davies on the Shooting script suggests that there was some
         debate about whether their dialogue should be picked up first with Dorothea

         or Will. It is Will in the Shooting script, but on screen it is Dorothea: ‘I am so
         glad to see you’. In the novel we’re told that she ‘uttered these common words

         with the simple sincerity of an unhappy child, visited at school’ (Ch.37, pp.135-6).
         In the dramatization she is more self-possessed, less sad. But for Eliot, as for

         Davies ultimately, it is important that Will’s line (‘I really came for the chance
         of seeing you alone’) is a response to hers, for he found himself ‘mysteriously

         forced to be just as simple as she was’ (p.136).</p>




      <p>The preliminary exchanges continue with Will’s chiding that ‘you spend all your days,
         shut up in doors, with these?’ as ‘he picks up one of the notebooks,

         grimaces and replaces it’. Dorothea’s lighter response – ‘Not all my days. Not all
         the hours in any day. And I am happy to be here’ - signals, Davies’ script

         annotation tells us, a ‘change of energy and humour here. Not too saintly’ (SS, p.3/47).
         That spirit of greater levity and the self-consciousness it reveals,

         sets the tone on both sides for what follows; these changes enable their gentle sparring
         to retain a lightness of touch, and some affectionate self-deprecation.</p>




      <p>Across this dialogue the action moves. The camera draws away from the medium close-ups
         that framed them in the cluttered library as Dorothea advances into

         the foreground space of the adjoining sitting-room which is flooded with sunlight,
         Ladislaw following after. Her command of the space pushes back the camera as

         she moves towards us. They sit now, opposite one another, on two silver-upholstered
         chesterfield settees. In the novel it is a ‘dark ottoman’ and there they take

         their seats much sooner in the conversation, Eliot tells us precisely, ‘at two yards'
         distance’ (p.136). She follows this with the beautiful line: ‘Each looked at

         the other as if they had been two flowers which had opened then and there.’ Interestingly,
         both scripts assume they are seated without directing exactly when. There

         are two parts to the conversation which ensues.</p>




      <p>First, there is Will’s revelation that he acted as Casaubon’s secretary, unsuccessfully,
         for a while. This enables Dorothea’s playful responses: ‘I should not

         have thought that post would have suited you’, and ‘Perhaps you were not a steady
         enough worker.’ This provokes Will’s criticism of Casaubon’s intolerance and

         insecurity (‘I am afraid he dislikes me because I too often ventured to disagree with
         him’), and Dorothea’s defensive reminder of her husband’s patronage: ‘And

         yet he overcame his dislike of you as far as his actions were concerned’. This dialogue
         seems to repeat a formula from Rome, in which Will fails to disguise his

         criticism of Casaubon and upsets Dorothea in the process. But here the tone, if not
         the substance, is markedly different. The narrative observes that ‘Dorothea

         was strangely quiet—not immediately indignant, as she had been on a like occasion
         in Rome’ (p.139). Indeed, the contrast is profound in performance – a playful

         banter that gives way to greater intimacy.</p>




      <p>The scene then enters a new phase in which Will recalls his family’s plight and shares
         childhood memories of his father and their poverty. But the hinge to

         this story is a disputed line from the novel: ‘It was an abominable thing that my
         Grandmother should have been disinherited’ (p.140). In the Shooting script Davies


         suggests ‘cut this?’. But in a story of 19th Century wealth and poverty where inheritance
         is such a dominant factor in the circumstances of so many characters,

         it was surely important to retain Will’s sense of cruel injustice (and its intimations
         of racial as well as social prejudice). Davies had second thoughts. A further

         annotated comment reads ‘SORRY. The “abominable” line can’t be cut. But if it could
         be done in a way that brought them together rather than draw them apart’

         (SS, p.3/48). So the line wasn’t cut, but deftly nuanced in the dramatization to allow
         Will’s softening acknowledgement of Casaubon’s own sense of duty: ‘He

         understood what an abominable thing it was for my Grandmother to be disinherited,
         merely for falling in love with a poor man!’ That subtle change softens Dorothea’s


         response and intimate enquiry: ‘I wonder how she bore the change from wealth to poverty.
         Do you know much about her?’ And Will’s answer begins with the simplicity

         of his romantic spirit (‘Well, she married for love. That's all.’) as a direct counterpoint
         to Dorothea’s own situation.</p>




      <p>Hereafter, gentle, stirring strings accompany Will’s sentimental family story, itself
         leavened with self-deprecation: ‘You see I come from rebellious blood

         on both sides’. In the Shooting script this is the end of Will’s story and the stage
         directions continue: ‘She's been looking very serious and intent. Now she

         smiles too.’ However, in the Post-production script more of Will’s testimony about
         his father from the novel is retained, almost verbatim: ‘I remember him playing

         the violin - and I remember his slow walk and I remember his long thin hands. And
         I remember once he'd been lying in bed for a long time - I think he was very ill

         - and all I could think of was how hungry I was and how I only had a little piece
         of bread.’’ Rufus Sewell conveys all this pathos in his beautifully measured,

         rather childlike delivery, as if fragments of memory are returning piecemeal. His
         gaze drifts to the ceiling, and down and away from her briefly. And the speech

         is accompanied tellingly with nervous physical twitches, as he fingers the studs on
         the arm of the chesterfield and picks at specks on his clothing.</p>




      <p>Yet, as Ladislaw’s story wins Dorothea’s approval of his intention to remain in Middlemarch,
         she remembers herself suddenly, and her husband. But Will won’t

         be detained and is keen ‘to use my body’ – a line of Davies’ invention - though the
         five-mile walk with the sun ‘on the wet grass’ is from the novel. The Lawrentian

         symbolism is potent, nonetheless. The stage directions give the subtext: ‘She smiles
         again. She would never allow herself to think how his youth and virility

         contrasts with Casaubon, but that is what she is responding to. He comes towards her.
         There's a lot of going on beneath the conscious level.’ Here, more than

         anywhere else the production, Aubrey and Sewell’s chemistry conveys this palpably.</p>

      <p id="comment-196"> <b>Commentary 20: Scene 3/41</b></p>




      <p>Will Ladislaw’s decision to remain in Middlemarch, inspired as much by Dorothea’s
         encouragement (in scene 3/32) as by her uncle’s offer of employment at <em>The

            Pioneer</em> newspaper, has the indirect effect of advancing still further the rift in the Casaubons’
         precarious marriage and the decline in Casaubon’s fragile health. At

         least three aspects of the adaptation process are significant in the transformation
         of these events: plot reordering, Dorothea’s character development, and the mise-en-scène

         of the bedroom scene at the heart of a broken relationship.</p>




      <p>Andrew Davies’ Shooting script follows Eliot’s narrative quite closely. After Will’s
         departure from Dorothea, her husband returns from the Archdeacon’s breakfast where
         Dr

         Spanning has heaped praise on his ‘late tractate on the Egyptian Mysteries’ (Ch.37,
         p.145). Dorothea innocently reports Ladislaw’s visit and his newfound employment and
         naively

         suggests that Will sought Casaubon’s opinion on the matter. Coldly dismissed by her
         husband, the subject is dropped. But, next morning, it provokes a letter from Casaubon
         to

         Ladislaw criticising his social impropriety in accepting the position and forbidding
         him from ‘from further reception at my house’ (p.148).</p>




      <p>In the first alteration from the novel, the Shooting script presents this letter as
         a voice-over segue into an invented scene at <em>The Pioneer</em> offices, where its scornful

         recipient pens an immediate, vitriolic reply, which in turn segues back as a voice-over
         to Casaubon reading it at his desk the same night: ‘He is coldly furious’ the stage


         direction states (SS, p.3/59). There follows a bedroom scene (3/41) which sees Casaubon’s
         jealous fury provoked by Dorothea’s suggestion that they should support Will

         financially in order to liberate him from the necessity of labour. Chapter 37 of the
         novel continues: ‘It is not right that he should be in the dependence of poverty while


         we are rich’ (p.153). Casaubon rebukes his wife roundly: ‘It is not for you to interfere
         between me and Mr Ladislaw, and still less to encourage communications from him to


         you which constitute a criticism on my procedure’ (p.154). ‘Poor Dorothea, shrouded
         in darkness’ (p.154), is both frightened by her husband’s anger and fearful of its
         toll

         upon his health: ‘But nothing else happened, except that they both remained a long
         while sleepless, without speaking again’ (p.155).</p>




      <p>Next morning, in the novel, Ladislaw’s reply arrives on Casaubon’s desk, adding insult
         to injury: ‘Poor Mr Casaubon felt (and must not we, being impartial, feel

         with him a little?) that no man had juster cause for disgust and suspicion than he’
         (p.156). In the Shooting script, this epistolary response has already served to enflame


         Casaubon’s night-time anger.  It is replaced with a short morning scene (3/42) in
         which Casaubon summons Pratt to request Mr Standish (his lawyer) make preparations
         to amend

         his will. This scene does not appear in the Post-production script, for good reason.
         It would have undermined the dramatic revelation of Casaubon’s legacy which in the
         final

         production hinges - symbolically if not realistically - upon the Shylockian bond of
         blind obedience to his will that he tries to secure from Dorothea, the night before
         his

         death (3/79)). Instead, the on-screen version defers the exchange of letters between
         Casaubon and Ladislaw until the morning after the bedroom row. In this way, Casaubon’s


         banishment of Ladislaw becomes a reaction not just to the news of his return to Middlemarch,
         but moreover to his wife’s entreaties on his behalf, which, as the novel describes,

         betray ‘a disposition to regard Will Ladislaw favourably and be influenced by what
         he said’ (p.157).</p>




      <p>The second aspect of transformation, therefore, concerns Dorothea herself. It is important
         that Davies’ adaptation implicates Dorothea (as well as Ladislaw) in Casaubon’s

         revenge. This is because Chapter 37 in the novel devotes a long passage between her
         report of Will’s visit and the bedtime dispute to her motivations which, although


         influenced by Ladislaw’s winning hard-luck story, are presented by Eliot as ‘her blindness’:
         an over-zealous pursuit of justice. For as Casaubon puts pen to paper,

         ‘Meanwhile Dorothea's mind was innocently at work towards the further embitterment
         of her husband’ (p.148). Her thoughts are preoccupied, in her private boudoir, by


         moral principles of duty: ‘Was inheritance a question of liking or of responsibility?’
         She arrives at this conclusion:</p>




      <p>It was true, she said to herself, that Mr Casaubon had a debt to the Ladislaws — that
         he had to pay back what the Ladislaws had been wronged of. And now she began to

         think of her husband's will, which had been made at the time of their marriage, leaving
         the bulk of his property to her, with proviso in case of her having children.

         That ought to be altered; and no time ought to be lost. (p.150)</p>




      <p>According to Noa Reich (2021, p.12), ‘This passage translates the complexities of
         inheritance into a deceptively simple question that seems to pit liberal, individual
         freedom

         against status expectations.’ And ‘the novel invites us to view Dorothea’s seeming
         idiosyncrasy as indicative of a broader, historical tension’ (2021, p.13). Crucially,
         it

         is Dorothea who first raises the issue of her husband’s will. And it is Dorothea’s
         obsession with doing what is morally right that blinds her to the wrong (in status
         terms)

         she is doing her husband in the process. This lays bare the flaw in her nature: how
         Dorothea mistakes spiritual devotion (to Casaubon) for love and love (for Ladislaw)
         for

         social justice. It is the task of Davies and of Aubrey to convey the results of this
         devastating combination of moral certitude and emotional immaturity in scene 3/41.</p>




      <p>Fortunately, in television drama, there are additional resources which aid the writer
         and the actor in conveying meaning. Indeed, in deconstructing the mise-en-scène of


         this particular scene, the adaptation’s patterns of dynamic repetition offer a diachronic
         montage of all the Casaubons’ ‘bedroom scenes’. It is interesting to note that

         there are four (all of Davies’ invention) which calibrate the declining fortunes of
         the Casaubon marriage. Although they span three episodes and, apparently, two

         different locations, close observation suggests that they were all shot in the same
         space, probably consecutively. The final Production schedules confirm that none were


         filmed at Lowick (Brympton d’Evercy). 1/86, set in Rome, is the only one in which
         the couple are depicted in bed together, and confirms that the marriage remains unconsummated;


         2/52 sees the bed-ridden Casaubon recovering from his heart-attack; 3/41 has Dorothea
         sitting beside the bed advocating passionately for Will Ladislaw’s provision, causing


         her husband to rise again and respond across the bed before blowing out the candle;
         in 3/81 Dorothea is in bed and it is Casaubon in the chair with a candle demanding
         her

         compliance with his last wishes. Again, they take sides, across the divide.</p>




      <p>Candlelight frames each speaker in a pool of intensity, not in a gothic, or film noir
         manner, but naturalistically. There is a dramatic contrast between the warmth of

         candlelight and their frosty relations, a candle’s flickering impermanence, and the
         decisiveness of the one who extinguishes the flame, bringing everything to an end.


         These are the nocturnal charades that constitute the most intimate scenes of their
         marriage. In the morning there are cold, grey ashes in the hearth. All the contrasting
         Lydgate

         bedroom scenes (beginning with 4/11) come after the death of Casaubon, though they
         too chart a (very different) sequence of declining relations.</p>

      <p id="comment-200">200. <b>Commentary 21: Scenes 3/43-3/44</b></p>




      <p>There are but two prominent nuclear families in Middlemarch, and both are situated
         in the new, aspirational artisan/manufacturing class: the Garths and the Vincys. It
         is not

         insignificant that amongst the main characters, the idealists Dorothea Brooke and
         Tertius Lydgate are both orphans who have been raised by wealthy guardian uncles.
         Both Fred

         Vincy and Will Ladislaw are in different ways listless and feckless, struggling to
         find their aim in life; both are also disinherited. Whilst Dorothea’s constant anxiety
         about

         her inheritance and her motivation to do some good in the world is because she has
         ‘always had too much of everything’, Lydgate has turned his back on his own noble
         family and

         reaps the financial consequences as a result of his stubborn idealism. As Phoebe Poon
         argues, ‘Eliot transformed the inheritance plot from a well-worn convention of material


         reward for heroic conduct into a powerful vehicle of critique against anachronistic
         customs of inheritance and succession’ (Poon, 2013: p.50). The newly-married Lydgates’
         visit

         to his family home at Quallingham is a very different honeymoon from the Casaubons’,
         but in the brief scenes (3/43 and 44) which are of Andrew Davies’ own invention, the
         viewer

         also discovers the terms of their mismatch away from home.</p>




      <p>Interestingly, not only does this incident not appear in the novel, it doesn’t appear
         in Andrew Davies’ Shooting script either. They are almost certainly the cut scenes
         noted

         at the bottom of page 3/63. Throughout the novel, in which Quallingham is referenced
         seventeen times, the family seat becomes an imaginary symbol of the Lydgates’ disintegrating


         marriage, representing to Rosamond the wealth, social elevation and escape from Middlemarch
         which she dreams their wedlock might deliver (and later the source of their financial


         rescue), and for Lydgate a reminder of his hubristic independence from material indolence
         and security, which comes to haunt him in their hour of need. Their honeymoon tour
         is

         reported by the narrator only in the context of Captain Lydgate’s subsequent flirtatious
         visit to Middlemarch: ‘Lydgate inwardly cursed his own folly that he had drawn down
         this

         visit by consenting to go to his uncle's on the wedding-tour, and he made himself
         rather disagreeable to Rosamond by saying so in private. For to Rosamond this visit
         was a source

         of unprecedented but gracefully concealed exultation’ (Ch.58, p.73).</p>




      <p>In the adaptation Quallingham is represented as a real place: Grimsthorpe Castle,
         near Bourne in Lincolnshire. That the Quallingham scene was excised from the Shooting
         script

         indicates that this was considered an optional extra, depending on budgetary contingencies.
         Script editor Susie Conklin reports: ‘Because Quallingham was a one-off location

         and an expensive one at that, it was an obvious one to go, especially as it wasn’t
         essential to the story.’ However, ‘Gerry [Scott, Production designer] found rooms
         at

         Grimsthorpe that didn’t need a lot of set decorating. And, because it was very close
         to our production base in Stamford, it suddenly became viable again’ (Conklin email


         correspondence, 2022) Grimsthorpe’s unadulterated splendour was ideal for a television
         audience; the arrival by coach up a gravel drive to a palatial country residence has


         become a standard visual entrée into heritage drama. Provincial Rosamond is certainly
         seduced by its grandeur as she and Lydgate make their approach in an open carriage


         through the static wide-angled establishing shot: ‘Tertius! You never told me how
         beautiful Quallingham was...’. This dialogue is recorded as voice-over (though this
         is

         unspecified in the script), which reinforces its narrational perspective that the
         viewer is invited to share. It makes a visual juxtapostion with lowering Lowick and,
         by

         implication, between the two central marriages: one fecund, the other barren. Serial
         television drama is motivated by dynamic contrasts. But its stately iconography aside,


         the Quallingham visit is intended, with Davies’ customary economy, to convey at least
         four pieces of information to the viewer.</p>




      <p>First, Rosamond and Lydgate are besotted with one another: ‘The wedding night had
         been no disappointment, we may infer. The lineaments of gratified desire are much
         in evidence,

         and LYDGATE's mood of lazy sensuality is evident in the next scene’, according to
         Davies’ concluding stage direction in scene 3/43 (PP, p.3/46). We cut to a

         medium close-up looking up at a ceiling painting in the State Dining Room: ‘The Arts
         and the Sciences’ (1725-30) by the Venetian Francesco Sleter (1685–1775) – a classical
         depiction

         of semi-naked cherubic figures suspended in the celestial firmament - part of Sir
         John Vanbrugh’s remodelling of Grimsthorpe, overseen by Nicholas Hawksmoor after Vanbrugh’s
         death.

         Secondly, Rosamond’s sexual attraction for her husband (and his ‘bore’ of a cousin)
         is matched only by her doe-eyed infatuation with the lineaments of aristocratic wealth:
         ‘I think it

         is the loveliest place I have ever been in... Oh, if I were ever to live here... I
         think I should die from happiness!’ (p.3/47). This betrays her material and social
         aspirations beyond

         the confines of Middlemarch and her concomitant naivety: ‘Pretty little thing TERTIUS
         has got himself, but obviously a complete idiot’ surmises Lydgate’s guardian uncle
         Sir Godwin over

         dinner, in Davies’ stage direction (p.3/48). You can take the girl out of Middlemarch,
         but… The party of four is seated on Regency gilded chairs around an opulent dining
         table, attended

         by bewigged footmen. The table is lusciously lit at dessert time with a dish of poached
         pears in red wine very much in the foreground before a voluptuously adorned Rosamond.</p>




      <p>Thirdly, the encounter reminds the viewer that beyond Middlemarch much of England’s
         male landed gentry (like Chettam) live untroubled by social change and disinterested


         in professional life. In this way, these brief scenes also stand in for Eliot’s historical
         perspective. As Sir Godwin observes, ‘quizzically’: ‘Country sawbones in a manufacturing


         town? Odd sort of profession for a gentleman. Hm?’ (p.3/48). Rosamond expresses interests
         in London or Bath (Davies channelling Regency Austen). To this, Lydgate responds with


         ‘lazy superiority’ on the opportunity ‘to make the town and hospital a model in medical
         care that the whole of Europe might envy’ (p.3/48), which underlines both his ambition
         and

         his hubris. Fourthly, in the service of plot development, the ogling epicurean Captain
         Lydgate secures himself an invitation for a return visit which will later demonstrate
         Rosamond’s

         susceptibility to flattery, her boredom with Lydgate’s practice, and her own hubristic
         riding accident that leads to a miscarriage. This is yet another moment (like Tyke’s
         election

         to the chaplaincy and Lydgate’s precipitous proposal) which leaves Lydgate upstaged
         by circumstance; once again the penultimate shot lingers on the face of one who looks
         ‘as if he

         has been mugged’; the last is of a triumphant Rosamond in full bloom. As in Austen,
         travel is a perilous pursuit for romantics. We cut to afternoon tea at Freshitt –
         a bit of a

         come-down.</p>

      <p>Scenes 3/50-51 depict Brooke’s visit to see his tenants, the Dagleys, accompanied
         by his niece. On the way to the cottage, the two converse. While Dorothea argues

         for ‘proper professional management’ of the estate, Brooke insists that he is ‘treasured’
         by his tenants. Robert Hardy delivers Brooke’s assurances with a

         characteristic blend of geniality and pomposity that renders his repeated claims that
         he is an ‘easy, uncommonly easy [landlord]’ hollow, however. And on arrival at

         Dagley’s cottage we meet Brooke’s tenant (Andrew Tiernan) ‘in a horrible temper and
         drunk enough not to give a damn what he says’ (Post-production script 3/51).

         When Brooke informs Dagley that he should reprimand his son for poaching, Dagley becomes
         outraged and bullishly ignores his wife’s (Jane Hollowood) efforts to calm

         him. ‘Worst landlord in the county!’ Dagley exclaims before threatening Brooke that
         the imminent Reform Bill will send him and his like ‘scuttling’ (PP 3/51). Brooke

         attempts to talk over the other man before nervously deciding ‘you’re drunk [….],
         we’ll talk another time, you know, another time,’ and he quickly returns to

         Dorothea (PP 3/51).</p>




      <p>While we see an establishing shot of the dilapidated property on Brooke’s arrival
         and then again on his exit, Eliot affords the state of the Dagley homestead a

         considerable amount of description in the novel. The narrator notes wryly that an
         artistic tradition which ‘makes other people’s hardships picturesque’ would

         have delighted here in the juxtaposition of luxuriant jasmine boughs and colourful
         hollyhocks with ‘grey worm-eaten shutters’, ‘pauper labourers’ and an overall

         impression of the ‘sad lack of farming capital’ (Ch.39, p.182-3). The novel holds
         Brooke at least partially responsible for the Dagleys’ poverty and repeatedly

         makes the point that he has failed to bear the weight of his duty. It is ‘astonishing’
         how rarely one’s conscience is twinged by ‘those who never complain or

         have nobody to complain for them’, the narrator muses sardonically before confirming:
         ‘Dagley’s homestead never before looked so dismal to Mr Brooke as it did

         to-day’ (Ch.39, p.182).</p>




      <p>Regarded in this light, Dagley’s outburst feels fairly warranted and while he clearly
         loses his temper, the scene is narrated relatively even-handedly in the

         novel. Brooke approaches his tenant with an affected bonhomie, addressing him patronisingly
         as ‘my good fellow’ and speaking ‘confidentially but not judiciously’

         (Ch.39, p.186). Tellingly, for all of its acknowledgement of Dagley’s failure to moderate
         his drinking, the chapter ends on a sombre and sympathetic tone. We are

         left with the mordant observation that Dagley’s cottage, Freeman’s End, must have
         been named ‘by way of sarcasm’ for there was no ‘earthly “beyond” open to him’

         and his family (Ch.39, p.189).</p>




      <p>Of course, as adaptor, Davies has to wrestle with how to convey Eliot’s elusive narrative
         or, rather, how much to convey. The Shooting script, for instance,

         gives a fuller sense of the Dagleys’ deprivation with Davies’ description of a garden
         gate ‘hanging precariously on its hinges’ supplemented by Dagley attempting

         to fix a broken window-shutter. He curses at the shutter and only when Brooke addresses
         him — ‘Ah, Dagley, my good fellow! — does he slam the shutter with a ‘last

         savage bang’, turn and address his landlord (Shooting script 3/51).</p>




      <p>By the Post-production script and the eventual episode, these details have been minimised
         and as mentioned above, we only see two glimpses of the full cottage.

         The exchange begins quickly and via shot-reverse shot filmed in medium close-up. The
         only exception to this is a cut to Dagley’s children peering out of a window

         when Dagley cries out that he and his family will ‘rot in the ground that we can’t
         find the money to buy’ (PP 3/51). Instead, mise-en-scène, costuming and make-up

         contribute evocatively to our understanding of the disparity between landlord and
         tenants; the Dagleys, dirty with torn clothing, are framed by the oppressive

         darkness of the cottage behind them, while Brooke, smartly and fashionably dressed,
         is well-lit and surrounded by countryside.</p>




      <p>The scene is thus an important reminder of the inequality within Middlemarch (and
         Brooke’s part therein) as well as the hopes of the 1832 Reform Act for tenant

         farmers like Dagley. In being adapted, however, its presence and impact seems to diminish:
         first in the transition from the novel to the Shooting script and

         then again from the Shooting script to the Post-production script. Although this may
         be the inevitable result of adaptive economy, it may be helpful to read

         the scene in light of the one which immediately preceded it. The visit falls just
         after Dorothea’s and Ladislaw’s conversation where she claims she has no

         longings beyond a wish she ‘hadn’t so much more than my share, without really doing
         anything for others’ (SS 3/49). Ladislaw’s retort that —unlike her — he

         doesn’t feel ‘bound’ to submit to what he does not like clearly unsettles Dorothea,
         as the camera lingers on Juliet Aubrey’s expression of anguish. Indeed, Davies’

         stage direction notes that ‘something disturbs her’ and it is on this uneasy note
         that the scene segues to Brooke’s and Dorothea’s journey to the Dagleys'.</p>




      <p>3/50 begins in a different tenor to the novel, therefore, but one which helps to accommodate
         the shifting emphasis of the Dagley scene onto Dorothea as well

         as Brooke and Dagley. In the novel, Dorothea’s wish for less privilege is part of
         a much more whimsical and playful conversation and Ladislaw’s retort that he

         doesn’t feel similarly ‘bound’ is met with a smile (Ch.39, p.180) rather than distress.
         Later on, however, Dorothea isn’t given the chance to advance her argument

         for better management (‘Mr Brooke, not being taken unawares, got the talk under his
         own control’ (Ch.39, p.181)). By comparison, Davies’ Dorothea is simultaneously

         confused by her exchange with Ladislaw yet able to help persuade her uncle so that
         she is vindicated on his return from the Dagleys when he agrees that Garth might

         make the best Estate manager. In this moment, Dorothea is proven right and confirmed
         for us is the ‘somewhat naïve’ but still ‘laudable’ quality of her idealism

         (Lothe, p.183). Although 3/50-51 still centre on Brooke’s fractious encounter with
         his tenants, his attitude is thus implicitly contrasted against Dorothea’s

         ambition to help the poor. As theatre historian Janette Dillon reminds us, being the
         last one to speak in a scene is a ‘powerful position’ because it ‘encourages

         the audience to see the action through the eyes of that closing perspective.’ It is
         significant, therefore, that despite Dagley’s inclusion in the adaptation

         (and the same cannot be said of other lower-class characters in the novel), the scene
         closes not on his precarious existence, but on Dorothea’s hopes.</p>

      <p>Scenes 3/79 through to 3/84 close Episode 3 on an uncertain note with the sudden discovery
         of Casaubon’s body following immediately after a pivotal chapter in

         his and Dorothea’s relationship. Only a couple of scenes prior to this, Casaubon had
         relented and enlisted Dorothea’s help in marking up his notebooks. But

         while Dorothea had hoped to assist her husband in this way ever since the start of
         their marriage, it now feels as though he has delivered what Davies calls

         ‘a life sentence’ (3/76). Davies observes darkly of the scene’s ending, ‘The task
         seems Herculean, hopeless’ (3/76), echoing Dorothea’s account of the futility

         of Casaubon’s intellectual labour (and her own part therein) as ‘a treadmill’ (Ch.
         48, p.313). Tension is thus high when Casaubon asks Dorothea if she will carry

         out his wishes on the event of his death: ‘whether you will avoid doing what I should
         deprecate, and do what I should desire’ (PP 3/79). Uncertain of how to

         respond to a request she does not understand, Dorothea pleads for more time before
         answering and Casaubon agrees. Anguished, Dorothea wrestles with the matter

         but is resolved in her mind the following morning. She heads to the Yew Tree Walk
         to meet Casaubon, apparently writing in the garden, but she discovers him dead,

         slumped over his desk.</p>




      <p>In the adaptation, it is left ambiguous and all the more menacing what Casaubon will
         require of his wife after his death (disinheritance should she marry Will

         and a requirement to complete The Key To All Mythologies). As Phoebe Poon writes,
         the theme of inheritance is a recurrent ‘point of stress’ in Eliot’s novels for

         its ability to animate tensions between the individual and the family (p.50). Davies
         thus provides a good amount of direction for Casaubon, writing that ‘He’s very

         intense. His eyes are staring’ (3/79). But while we are meant to recognise the ‘deep-eyed
         inner fire’ which first attracted Dorothea, Davies notes that it is now a

         ‘pale fire, a sick one’ (3/79). He continues even more ominously, ‘it’s a hand reaching
         out to control her from the grave’ (3/79).  The only explicit guide to

         Dorothea’s delivery by comparison is the simple description: ‘She hesitates’ (3/79).
         Juliet Aubrey’s response is perhaps appropriately vague in her shocked expression


         then, maintaining focus on Patrick Malahide’s fevered intensity.</p>




      <p>The novel, however, anticipates something of the nature of Casaubon’s request, if
         only by establishing that Dorothea incorrectly assumes what she is being

         asked to do. The narrator confides in us that Dorothea had ‘no presentiment that the
         power which her husband wished to establish over her future action had

         relation to anything else than his work’ (Ch.48, pp.311-2). The sheer extent of her
         mental anguish over the difference between ‘devotion to the living and

         that indefinite promise of devotion to dead’ (Ch.48, p.314) thus proves darkly ironic
         on two accounts: the first, that Dorothea fails to foresee the actual

         restriction Casaubon will place on her and indeed, that he does so as a jealous riposte
         to her suggestion he favours Ladislaw in his will. The second, that because

         of his untimely death Dorothea does not even deliver ‘her answer’ (Ch.48, p.318).</p>




      <p>In an episode which opens with another death and uncertain inheritance (Featherstone’s)
         it seems likely then that Davies left Casaubon’s dying wish deliberately

         unspecified (or even hinted at) in order to postpone the surprise codicil in his will.
         The bookending of the episode in this way contributes to one of the more

         striking structural adaptations in Davies’ dramatisation: its organisation on an episodic
         level. Crucially, by postponing the revelation of Casaubon’s ‘abuse of

         testamentary power’ (Poon, p.66), the episode also draws out the emotional resonance
         and narrative impact of what is, in many ways, one of the more challenging

         aspects of adapting Middlemarch: rendering Casaubon and Dorothea’s curious relationship
         in a way which is credible and potentially moving.</p>




      <p>Tellingly, tracing this sequence’s development from the novel through Shooting script
         and into Post-production script reveals other strategies to emphasise the

         suddenness of Casaubon’s death in spite of his clearly failing health. In both versions
         of the script, Davies’ stage directions code Casaubon’s illness. He is

         described as ‘feverishly agitated’ in the Shooting script’s version of 3/76; at night,
         he makes such a ‘sudden groaning sound’ that it wakes Dorothea (SS 3/79 and

         PP 3/79) and later, he sleeps ‘breathing heavily’ (SS 3/80 and PP 3/80). Yet evidently,
         the production refrained from some of these choices. Malahide looks ashen

         but sits upright and with focused attention on Dorothea when making his request. In
         this regard, the episode follows the novel’s cue which makes no reference to

         Casaubon’s physical state at this crucial moment.</p>




      <p>Indeed, the novel throws the reader something of a red herring with a reminder of
         Lydgate’s diagnosis and forcing Dorothea to reckon with the possibility of 15

         more years married to her husband. It also draws out even further the reader’s realisation
         that Casaubon has indeed died. There is an additional library

         conversation between husband and wife, Dorothea’s preparations for the morning and
         a fleeting insight into Pratt, the butler. Both novel and the television

         series build suspense in their own way, however. In combination with the events described
         above, the novel does this by prevarication: we are made aware of

         quite how reluctantly Dorothea agrees to meet Casaubon and deliver her answer (‘she
         was fettered’ (Ch.48, p.317), for instance). Ironic foreshadowing also toys

         with our expectations. Frustrated by her love for the ‘gentle creature for whom she
         felt unable to do anything more’, Tantripp notes sourly that she wishes ‘every

         book in that library was built into a caticom’ for Casaubon (Ch.48, p.316).</p>




      <p>By comparison, the adaptation moves more decisively towards its climax in its depiction
         of that morning’s events. We have a much clearer dramatic line from waking,

         through to (resigned) resolution and confrontation. Also excised is Pratt who the
         Shooting script depicts in conversation with Tantripp in 3/83 as Dorothea hurries


         to the gardens. And when we reach the tragic discovery of Casaubon’s body, Davies
         writing is evocative but perfunctory. There is an intriguing slip in Davies’ adaptive


         authority voice when he notes, ‘[Casaubon’s] dead. I think she knows’ (PP 3/84) and
         the ending of the episode seems to rest in this uncertain melancholic register.

         Just as Davies clearly wrestles with how to adapt this unconventional couple for screen,
         the episode itself seems to want its audience to feel ambivalently about Casaubon’s


         passing.</p>




      <p>Key to this is Christopher Gunning’s orchestration for this sequence. Gunning explains
         that Casaubon makes an ‘impossible’ demand on Dorothea, throwing her into a

         state of ‘deep anxiety’, but by the following morning, she has reached a point of
         ‘resolution’), and all of this is expressed musically. Gunning’s soundtrack for

         Dorothea’s late-night deliberations, for instance, is led by the keening melancholy
         of a cor anglais. The solo is accompanied by strings whose rapidly ascending and

         descending arpeggios and sustained tremolo ratchet up the scene’s intensity. These
         ‘dark anxious chords’ (Gunning interview, 4) continue, albeit more quietly, into the


         following scene but when Dorothea seemingly makes up her mind in the garden, the music,
         too, resolves itself. Two solos — clarinet and then cello — with ascending

         melodies accompany Dorothea to Casaubon’s side and when she crouches by him, long-held
         notes draw out the hopefulness of this moment musically. As Gunning reveals,

         the ‘whole idea was not to give the game away that he’d died. [….] You think he’s
         asleep, that’s all’(4). Thus, when Casaubon’s death is revealed, the soundtrack

         stops entirely, leaving only Dorothea’s speech and the background noises of the garden.
         It is only when Aubrey delivers her final line (‘Wake, dear. I am here now’

         (PP 3/84)), that the music returns. And it does so with a gentle crescendo that resolves
         — somewhat uncomfortably — Gunning’s earlier ‘anxious’ strings into an

         eventual unison. Like Dorothea, the viewer is left unsure of what Casaubon’s death
         means.</p>

      <p id="comment-215">215. <b>Commentary 24: Scene 4/1</b></p>




      <p> Andrew Davies comments 'At one time I had a disagreement with Louis Marks and Susie
         Chapman about the construction of Episodes 4 and 5, and I did two completely different


         versions of Episodes 4 and 5, constructed in completely different ways in order to
         demonstrate to them that their idea was not as good as my idea.' (Davies, 1993, p.91).</p>




      <p>This disruption is not, however, present in the opening scenes of Episode 4 where
         there is less reordering of material across episode boundaries than is in evidence
         in

         earlier episodes, with scenes 4/1-4 remaining in sequence at the start of both scripts.
         Scene 4/1 where is a Davies-imagined scene of political agitation in Middlemarch

         market square which sets up viewers for the subsequent scene (4/2) at <em>The Pioneer</em> office Ladislaw and Brooke where discuss the most pragmatic ways to advance reform.</p>




      <p>This opening scene centres around Tonks, an itinerant agitator for reform, addressing
         lower class townsfolk on the need for expansion of ‘the vote’ so that they

         can put men from their own ranks in parliament. It is set in March 1831 only 15 months
         before the Reform Act of 1832 came into force. In the Shooting script Davies

         foregrounds Ladislaw as one of the crowd attempts to button hole him to listen to
         the agitator’s speech. But by the Post-production script, Tonks is heard first, to
         help

         give the viewer their bearings, and then Sparks – clearly a character from the lower
         classes, invites Ladislaw to stop.  Sparks’ comment ‘just the man’ (4/1) suggests


         that the charismatic Ladislaw is now known and liked by the lower ranks of Middlemarch
         as well as the middle-class and the landed folk of the surrounding countryside.

         Significantly, however, although Ladislaw greets people on his way across the market
         square, he does not stop. While he has a job to get to, viewers learn later in scene


         4/2 and in his debate with Lydgate in scene 4/20, that he does not sanction more radical
         moves to gain the vote as the best way forward. In the novel, where he and Brooke


         discuss reform, Ladislaw warns against ‘revolutionist’ policies (Ch.60, p.344) and
         his action in eschewing the agitator in 4/1 support this in Davies’ adaptation. John


         Sutherland suggests that Ladislaw may in part have been modelled on Eliot’s view of
         the young Disraeli who had views in common with Will on more moderate political reform


         in the lead-up to the Second Reform Bill of the 1860s.</p>




      <p>Sparks recurs later in Episode 4 in the Hustings scene (according to the Production
         schedule shot the day before 4/1 on 4 August 1994). There he is the character who


         asks Dagley if Brooke is a manufacturer and is thence drawn into heckling Brooke’s
         misjudged address to the crowd. He is representative of the politically curious unenfranchised


         man in an industrialising town, who is attracted to Ladislaw’s views but whom Brooke
         fails to engage.</p>




      <p>The irony, Carolyn Steedman asserts, is that it is to Lydgate’s class (the £10 householders),
         not to Sparks', that political agitation during the 1820s gave the vote, through

         the resulting 1832 Reform Act. Eliot accurately represents in scene 4/23 the fact
         that ‘Freemen’ of trade such as Mawmsey already possessed the vote in Coventry prior
         to

         1832 but many people of profession and the new industries did not (Steedman 2001,
         p.539).</p>




      <p>The focus in scene 4/1 switches half-way to the fears of reform among the conservative
         professional classes. Hawley derides the words of Tonks as ‘Seditious poppycock’

         SS. 4/2), thus allowing him more ammunition to wind up the crowd with ‘the tide is
         turning’ and soon all ‘fine Tory gentlemen’ will ‘be swept away on it’ (SS 4/2).

         The agitator’s effective metaphor may come easily to Davies but in interview he reveals
         that he turned often for historical context to producer, Louis Marks:'He was a historian
         and

         I relied on him quite a lot to tell me what the Reform Bill was about. I would ask
         him "Do we need this? Is it important? What’s it about?" and he’d tell me. I was lucky
         to have a

         producer who was so well read academically' (Davies 2022, pp.6-7)</p>




      <p>Louis Marks was determined on reproducing a fine level of historical accuracy, so
         ‘conscious’ was he ‘of the reality of this world’ down to the ‘minutest detail of
         the

         things that were being offered for sale on market stalls…’ (Marks 1993, p.118) also
         evidenced in scene 4/1. Through this he hoped to convey the essence of the novel which


         importantly to him ‘is the best portrayal of England and Englishness… in any of the
         works that I know’ (Marks 1993, p.159).</p>




      <p>Davies concludes this scene of serious historical content on a characteristic lighter
         note, perhaps reflecting another aspect of ‘Englishness’ – mild francophobia. After


         Hawley’s claim of sedition, he goes on to assert that Tonks is ‘talking revolution’.
         While Wrench claims it ‘would never happen in England’ where he assumes political


         moderation and orderly reform will always prevail, he expresses his disdain that it
         has happened in France with the dismissive ‘Well, France…’ (PP 4/4) as he and Hawley


         walk out of frame. </p>

      <p id="comment-220">220. <b>Commentary 25: Scenes 4/6-4/7a</b></p>




      <p>These two short scenes, the first liberally adapted from Chapter 45 of the novel where
         Lydgate’s notions of charging for consultations rather than prescriptions become the
         talk of Middlemarch,

         and the second, where Farebrother warns his friend about getting into debt and given
         a different setting by Davies, are pivotal in revealing to the viewer how blind Lydgate
         is to the mesh that is enclosing him.

         In the Shooting script these scenes appear early in Episode 4 and follow Chettam’s
         outrage at discovering the codicil to Casaubon’s will and the damage this will do
         to Dorothea’s reputation.

         In the Post-production script, they appear later, after a more positive scene where
         Lydgate recommends Farebrother to Dorothea for Rector of Lowick.</p>




      <p>The focus on Farebrother and Lydgate continues through these scenes, but the former
         proves himself more knowing about Middlemarchers and their entrenched ways than the
         newcomer. In scene 4/6

         Lydgate is accosted by the grocer Mawmsey from the ‘Top Market’ (Ch.45, p.259), who
         enquires politely why Mrs Mawmsey has not received her strengthening medicine. He
         is bemused when Lydgate ridicules

         such placebos and suggests, ‘Let her take a glass of wine with her dinner’. He explains,
         condescendingly that if doctors could charge for their visits it would curb overprescribing
         – indeed ‘overdosing

         the king’s lieges’ which is ‘the worst kind of treason’. Farebrother may smile at
         this analogy, but it leaves Mawmsey and his assistant confused. In Chapter 45, Lydgate
         talks to Mawmsey then mounts his

         horse and is off, and Mawmsey takes this news upstairs to his wife where she exclaims,
         ‘I should like him to tell me how I could bear up at Fair time, if I didn't take strengthening
         medicine for a

         month beforehand’ (Ch.45, p.261). Lydgate has offended both Mrs Mawmsey and Mr Mawmsey
         who, according to Eliot’s narrator, prides himself on being able to afford medicines
         for his family and is secure

         in his opinion that, ‘If physic had done harm to self and family, I should have found
         it out by this time’ (Ch.45, p.261). In this brief scene, Davies distils the mood
         of the whole chapter where the

         Middlemarch medics, as well as patients like Mrs Mawmsey, discuss Lydgate’s new ideas
         with disdain leading, in Chapter 46, to their refusal to work at the new Fever Hospital.</p>




      <p>The character of Mawmsey is itself a distillation by Davies of the Middlemarch mentality.
         Eliot describes him as a grocer ‘whose retail deference was of the cordial, encouraging
         kind —jocosely

         complimentary’ (Ch.45, p.259), which lulls Lydgate into his smugly humorous analogy
         of ‘overdosing the king’s lieges’. In fact, the novel tells that Mawmsey’s mask of
         seeming dullness belies his

         cunning, revealed when he crows to his wife: ‘I was not going to tell him my opinion.
         Hear everything and judge for yourself is my motto. …People often pretend to tell
         me things, when they might

         as well say, “Mawmsey, you're a fool”’ (Ch.45, p.261). The essence of this character
         is embodied in Ken Campbell’s performance, down to his red hair ‘arranged in a flame-like
         pyramid’ (Ch.45, p.259).

         Campbell himself was described in his obituary as ‘an irrepressibly jovial elf, with
         a thin streak of malicious devilry about him - he was Puck, hobgoblin’ (Coveney, 2008),
         which is not too far

         away from Eliot’s Mawmsey. While he is smiling and deferential in craving Lydgate’s
         attention, once he is out of earshot he mutters cantankerously, ‘Mrs. Mawmsey is not
         a well woman. Mrs. Mawmsey

         <em>needs</em> her strengthening medicine.’ Partly because of Lydgate’s poor explanation and superior
         disregard, but also due to Middlemarch’s resistance to change, the viewer knows that
         Mawmsey remains

         unpersuaded by the doctor’s obscure logic.</p>




      <p>Davies’ penchant for a walk-and-talk scene again comes to the fore in scene 4/7a as
         Lydgate and Farebrother progress down the main street and pass the church. His dialogue
         for Lydgate neatly

         transitions from the conversation with Mawmsey, as he complains about ‘these Middlemarchers’
         being both ‘slow to take on new ideas’ and ‘slow to pay their bills’. Thus, Davies
         provides the

         wiser Farebrother with the chance to advise Lydgate that in order ‘to be wholly independent
         of their ignorance and spite, it's as well not to incur too many debts.’ (This is
         Davies’ only use

         of the term ‘Middlemarchers’ whereas in the novel it is used seven times – first by
         Mrs Cadwallader as she observes the guests from the town at Dorothea and Casaubon’s
         engagement dinner in

         Chapter 10.) Eliot introduces Farebrother’s intervention on the topic of money matters
         in Chapter 46 where, in the comfort of his study, he advises Lydgate to 'keep clear
         of wanting small sums that

         you haven't got' (Ch.46, p. 277). Lydgate, the narrator explains, takes these hints
         from his friend 'though he would have hardly have borne them from any other man' (Ch.46,
         p.277) such is his extreme

         pride. In the Shooting script, however, Davies’ Lydgate introduces the subject lightly
         – because debt is not yet an insurmountable burden in his mind and the script echoes
         the doctor’s interior monologue

         in Chapter 58 when ‘a man in setting up a house and preparing for marriage finds that
         his furniture and other initial expenses come to between four and five hundred pounds’
         (Ch.58, p.83). In the

         Shooting script for 4/7a, Lydgate can still imagine that asking Rosy to ‘cut our coat
         according to our cloth’ (while ‘smiling fondly’) will be the solution. But by the
         Post-production script this notion

         has been cut from Lydgate’s lines along with his fantasy of her rising from the waves
         like Boticelli’s Venus needing no fine clothes, in fact ‘no adornment’ at all. This,
         and Farebrother’s resulting

         joke, may have been deemed out-dated for a 1990s television audience and instead the
         scene ends with Lydgate claiming he takes Farebrother’s point even though he has just
         said that domestic economy is

         ‘easier said than done’.</p>




      <p>Scene 4/7b, which only appears in the Shooting script, is a counterpart to 4/7a in
         that having warned Lydgate against incurring debts in Middlemarch, Farebrother then
         warns him against allying

         himself too closely with Bulstrode, advising him to ensure that ‘people can see fresh
         air between you’. Lydgate it seems is in danger of being tainted in the eyes of Middlemarch
         not only by

         his own novel professional ideas but also by the company he keeps. This sense is conveyed
         visually in the production by the women Lydgate and Farebrother pass by in scene 4/7a.
         Davies states in his

         stage directions that ‘they are quite clearly gossiping about them’ (SS 4/7a) and
         while they greet Farebrother they do not greet his companion. Once the two men pass,
         the women ‘turn away and

         continue their conversation’ (SS 4/7a). Structurally, scene 4/7a is crafted to remind
         the audience of Lydgate’s previous walk-and-talk scene with Farebrother at the hospital
         in SS 1/13 and also

         of his walk across town with Bulstrode in SS 2/45, again shadowed by the Middlemarch
         gossips, when he is warned off paying his attentions to Rosamond. These visual motifs
         and repeated scenarios

         build a sense of foreboding that may equate with the ’sarcastic hand of destiny’ in
         Eliot’s narrative. Davies deploys these recurrent dramatic markers to show that by
         increments, and despite the

         kind warnings of his friend, Lydgate is on his way down.</p>

      <hr>






      <p id="comment-225">225. <b>Commentary 26: Scene 4/20</b></p>




      <p>Chapter 46 of <em>Middlemarch</em> begins with a Spanish proverb: ‘Since we cannot get what we like, let us like what
         we can get’ (p. 282). Unlike many of Eliot’s epigraphs, the proverb

         is both translated and located for the reader, and it serves as an excellent example
         of the novel’s frequent ‘split [….] against itself, where what is asserted at one
         point is

         questioned or negated at another’ (Ginsburg, p.542). Ginsburg continues, the ‘dialogical’
         quality to Eliot’s varied narrative techniques provides ‘no simple, positive truth


         presented for the reader’s edification’ (p.552). Indeed, the chapter that follows
         tests this maxim, debating whether either Ladislaw or Lydgate can accomplish their
         political

         aims (to like what they can get) while in bed with Brooke and Bulstrode. This commentary
         will thus focus on the culmination of the chapter’s interest in moral expediency —
         an

         evening at the Lydgates. By examining this scene, one can chart Davies’ simultaneous
         adaptation and discussion of the shaping principle of this chapter, as well as his
         divergence

         from the novel towards a more determined reading of Ladislaw in particular.</p>




      <p>Examining the progression of scene 4/20 from Shooting script to Post-production script
         continues to reveal Davies’ characterisation of Lydgate as a quasi-tragic figure;
         a man

         increasingly trapped between his ambitions and the mundane reality of living in Middlemarch.
         There is, for instance, a much quicker trajectory to 4/20 in the Post-production

         script, occurring after only seven scenes, compared to the Shooting script’s fourteen.
         Relocated to after 4/20 are Lydgate’s refusal to prescribe Mrs Mawmsey’s ‘strengthening


         medicine’ and, most importantly, Farebrother’s caution about town opposition and continued
         association with Bulstrode (the latter is also significantly cut). Arguably these


         scenes serve well in their original position because they illustrate precisely the
         tensions which a ‘stung’ and ‘nettled’ Ladislaw uses in retaliation to Lydgate’s barbs
         (SS 4/20).</p>




      <p>The finished version of 4/20 is not without these pressures though, and in many ways
         Davies’ condensation of Chapter 46 only heightens their visibility as Lydgate is challenged


         about his association with the banker across the episode. In the novel, Ladislaw poses
         his friend the hypothetical question: 'If there were one man who would carry you a
         medical

         reform and another who would oppose it, should you inquire which had the better motives
         or even the better brains?’ (Ch.46, p.293). Unsurprisingly, Lydgate’s response touches


         upon Bulstrode, but he is not explicitly asked to. By comparison, in both the Shooting
         script and Post-production script, Ladislaw is irritated by Lydgate's dismissal of
         Brooke

         as 'part of the very disease that needs curing'. After claiming he endorses the man
         who supports those previously unrepresented, Ladislaw questions, 'What about you?
         You want

         medical reform and there's a man who'll help you deliver it. Are you going to reject
         him because of his morals or his motives? I don't think so ' (SS 4/20). Even if introduced


         on similarly abstract terms ('a man'), Bulstrode is thus much more clearly the subtext
         to Ladislaw’s argument and Lydgate is required to qualify that he values his independence


         too much to ‘cry up Bulstrode on any personal ground’ (SS 4/20).</p>




      <p>Davies’ adaptation of the scene thus seems to align Ladislaw and Lydgate as men wrestling
         with essentially the same difficulty: the necessity — or indeed, inevitability — of


         compromising one’s integrity to work with what is ‘not ideal’ but ‘good enough’ to
         accomplish one’s moral purpose (SS 4/20). Of course, this is not wholly removed from
         the novel,

         which engineers Ladislaw’s and Lydgate’s conversation for similar effect. But pairing
         the two young men in this way reduces some of the subtlety of Ladislaw’s characterisation
         in

         the service of more easily positioning him within the social and political landscape
         of Middlemarch. In the novel, for instance, Ladislaw’s allegiance to reform is clearly


         contingent on his attachment to Dorothea. While he agrees with the principles of reform,
         we are told that he could have just as easily been ‘rambling in Italy sketching plans
         for

         several dramas, trying prose and finding it too jejune, trying verse and finding it
         too artificial’. For Ladislaw, ‘self-culture’ is the ‘principle point’ (Ch.46, p.285);


         reform and political writing are convenient — if enjoyable — modes of expression.
         Indeed, he is flattered by Brooke’s comparison of his expression with that of Edmund
         Burke.

         When Brooke continues that they ought to buy Ladislaw a pocket borough to guarantee
         men of such ‘talent’ a place in parliament, he notes that pocket boroughs can be a
         ‘fine

         thing […] if they [are] always in the right pocket’ (Ch.46, p.284). In the adaptation,
         however, Sewell’s Ladislaw passionately rebukes Brooke for the same offer. Ladislaw


         reminds him that 'one of the prime purposes of reform is to remove pocket boroughs'
         and vows that if elected, he will work to remove such 'moribund, cruel complacency'
         (SS 4/2).

         Of course, smoothing away some of the complexities of Ladislaw’s character has an
         additional benefit for Davies: he can more readily be positioned as a young, vital,
         and

         passionate counterpart to Casaubon. Although Sewell’s characteristic intensity and
         striking, pale gaze conveys effectively enough the apparent ‘irregularity […of Ladislaw’s]


         dangerously mixed blood’ (Ch.46, p.289), some of his stranger foibles are also absent
         from this scene. Ladislaw doesn’t vie with the Lydgate’s spaniel for space on the
         rug;

         he sits opposite from Lydgate at the table, his narrative counterpoint and intellectual
         equal.</p>

      <p id="comment-230">230. <b>Commentary 27: Scene 4/23</b></p>




      <p>In scene 4/23, Mr Brooke (Robert Hardy) visits Mr Mawmsey (Ken Campbell) while canvassing.
         This is a meeting of some importance for the aspiring politician because while Brooke
         is both his social

         superior and his customer, Mawmsey is — the novel tells us — ‘a chief representative
         in Middlemarch of that great social power, the retail trader, and naturally one of
         the most doubtful voters in the

         borough’ (Ch.50, p.345). Brooke fails to capitalise on this opportunity, though. Seeking
         to distinguish himself from the Tories who have already threatened to cancel their
         accounts with the grocer, Brooke

         assures Mawmsey that he will not go elsewhere ‘as long as my butler brings me good
         reports of your sugar and spices’ (PP 4/23). In doing so, Mawmsey is freed to vote
         Tory without ‘the painful necessity

         […] of disappointing respectable people whose names were on his books’ (Ch.50, p.345).</p>




      <p>The exchange between the two men exemplifies not only Brooke’s inability to represent
         the possibilities of reform to voters, but Lydgate’s censure of Middlemarchers as
         small-minded and resistant to change

         (‘the ignorance of people about here is stupendous’ (Ch.44, p.253)). Both the novel
         and Davies’ adaptation focus on the former failing over the latter. The Shooting script
         version of the scene in particular

         lampoons Brooke by emphasising the way that Mawmsey outmanoeuvres him. Davies imagines
         the conversation taking place outside of the grocers, surrounded by Mawmsey’s assistants
         who start ‘grinning’ as soon as

         their employer ruefully explains that he has to ‘look at [reform] in a family light’
         (SS 4/23). The assistants’ merriment only increases as the scene progresses, as does
         Mawmsey’s pleasure at ‘his triumph’

         when he ‘salute[s]’ Brooke ironically for ‘the promise you were good enough to give
         me not to withdraw your esteemed custom, vote or no vote’ (SS 4/23). One of the assistants
         takes Brooke’s sherry glass, he

         is bid goodbye, ‘battled’ by the exchange and Mawmsey continues with business as usual.</p>




      <p>The Shooting script thus emphasises Mawmsey’s canniness, as well as the power he wields
         within his own domain implied by frequent cuts between the grocer and a chorus of
         knowing, grinning assistants. A later

         decision to shoot the scene inside the shop necessitated a good deal more set building
         and set dressing than using just the exterior. But the relocation similarly conveys
         Mawmey’s assuredness in dealing with Brooke.

         The addition of a line first present in the novel, ‘Those very words spoken from that
         very chair you’re in now’ to the Post-production script, for instance, confirms that
         Mawmsey has already entertained other

         candidates in the same set-up.</p>




      <p>Mawmsey’s confidence aside, the scene takes on a slightly different tenor in the Post-production
         script as dialogue has also been cut and simplified. In a nod to the earlier version
         of the scene, Davies writes

         that Mawmsey exchanges glances and ‘winks’ with his assistant (PP 4/23), but the gesture
         is somewhat lost on screen as Campbell turns away from the camera to address his employees
         before smiling, and ushers Hardy

         into the next room. From there the scene continues in medium close-up and Brooke is
         saved some of the embarrassment of a quasi-public besting. Indeed, one feels that
         the resultant scene places less emphasis on the

         pleasure of watching Mawmsey outsmart Brooke — although he clearly does this still
         — than watching Brooke fall into, and belatedly realise, the trap Mawmsey has set
         him; a trap set in both the novel and Davies’

         scripts by Mawmsey’s emotive question, ‘will Reform support Mrs Mawmsey and our six
         children when I am no more? (PP 4/23).</p>




      <p>Davies must find evident use in these kind of scene endings, as the humorous and ironic
         quality of the denouement serves a quasi-narrative function. One might compare, for
         instance, Brooke’s encounter with Mawmsey

         against Lydgate’s experience at the Hospital election. In this scene, Davies notes
         that Brooke ends the scene on the realisation that ‘It's all been very pleasant, but
         something's mysteriously gone wrong’ (PP 4/23).

         Certainly, by cutting straightforwardly between just Mawmsey and Brooke, we are given
         sufficient time to watch Brooke slowly realise that he has been outplayed. The scene
         ends with a delicious couple of seconds on

         Hardy, his eyes darting up and side-to-side in anxious thought, his mouth readying
         in an ‘o’ and his fingers grasping for a retort that clearly eludes him.</p>




      <p>The final version of 4/23 is helped in its slight shift of focus, moreover, by the
         reinstatement of an establishing scene immediately before it, which does not appear
         in the Shooting script. On their approach to

         Mawmsey’s shop, Ladislaw cautions Brooke that he needs to ‘let them [voters] know
         where you stand [….]. Wavering arguments won’t win wavering votes’ (PP 4/22). Ladislaw’s
         words are doubly ironic. They quite

         deliberately echo and invert Brooke’s impression in the novel that wavering voters
         will be won by ‘wavering statements’ (Ch.50, p.344). And of course, Ladislaw is proven
         right only minutes later when Mawmsey rebuffs

         Brooke’s genial assurances that reform is vital because ‘we’re all one family’ (PP
         4/23). Mawmsey effectively silences Brooke in what Eliot calls ‘a decisive check’
         (Ch.50, p.346). ‘That goes a bit deep for me’,

         Mawmsey retorts; the grocer’s canny self-interest is directly at odds with Brooke’s
         woolly bonhomie.</p>




      <hr>






      <p id="comment-235">235. <b>Commentary 28: Scenes 4/32-4/32a</b></p>




      <p>The Hustings (scene 4/32) is a big set piece and it is no coincidence that it falls
         right at the very heart of Episode 4. It was one of the most demanding scenes to build
         and stage during the

         Stamford shoot of July-August 1993 and was preceded by the transformation of St George’s
         Square with the construction of the hustings platform and then the assembling of a
         seemingly vast Middlemarch

         crowd. This consisted of many Stamford residents as extras and, according to the Call
         sheet, a host of minor characters, ranging from Caleb Garth’s apprentice Tom, to Hopkins
         the undertaker to farm

         labourer Timothy Cooper, and Jenkins the printer.</p>




      <p>With this scene set, Brooke and his supporting committee emerge from the White Hart
         and up the steps to the platform. The Shooting script differs in its opening to 4/32
         from the Post-production script.

         The latter introduces Brooke via Dagley and Mr Sparks (adapting dialogue subsumed
         from SS, 4/30) before Ladislaw launches into his fulsome introduction of Brooke. In
         asking if Brooke is a ‘manufacturer’

         Sparks illustrates that the working man of Middlemarch has no prior knowledge of his
         potential representative in Parliament. And Brooke’s tenant, Dagley, is keen to paint
         him as a bad country landowner

         growing ‘fat as a pig while poor folk’s children starve’ (PP, p.4/47).</p>




      <p>In contrast, when Ladislaw addresses the crowd, his inclusive language and tone, with
         ‘Fellow citizens of Middlemarch’, ‘My friends’ (SS, p.4/50) and his perpetual use
         of the pronouns ‘we’ and ‘our’,

         immediately stamp him as a man of the people. Indeed, Davies’ annotations to the Shooting
         script (SS 4/50) show that he deletes the only sentence from Will’s first speech where
         he introduces himself

         using ‘I’ and ‘me’. The inference is that he is already well known to Middlemarchers.
         Ladislaw’s use of rhetoric throughout is innate and compelling. He places the political
         change that is coming in

         the context of the sweep of history, tells the crowd that this is what they want and
         ‘have deserved’, and makes it clear that it will come peacefully not through ‘bloody
         revolution’ or ‘civil war’

         (SS, p.4/50). His rhetorical questions (for instance, ‘Is this not good news?’) keep
         the audience engaged and inspire hope for real change. And he primes the crowd for
         the fact that Brooke is the man

         to deliver this change. The power of this speech is all the more curious for the fact
         that Ladislaw is given no voice at the hustings in the novel. In Chapter 51, it is
         reported that an anonymous political

         man from Brassing delivers the build-up to Brooke while Ladislaw stands in the window
         opening out on to the balcony where the hustings take place. In only a few short speeches,
         Davies seizes the opportunity

         to demonstrate Will’s talent and passion for politics which his lack of status and
         entitlement in the novel does not allow.</p>




      <p>Leading with Ladislaw’s fervent speech, Davies’ script and the ambiance of the production
         evokes  the scale of mass unrest during a time of political change, in the way that
         only the visual medium of

         television drama can. It comes closer than Eliot does to the political edginess of
         newly industrialising towns like Coventry in the early 1830s. Historian Carolyn Steedman
         criticises Eliot for continually

         viewing history through the ‘filter of culture’ (Steedman 2001, p.547), although she
         acknowledges that, due to her “exile” from Coventry, Eliot would not have had access
         to town records from just before

         the Reform Bill which might have led to the ‘<em>Middlemarch</em>’s extremely low-key election riot’ being written differently (Steedman 2001, p.541).
         Eliot’s ‘<em>Middlemarch</em>

         notebooks’ may refer to ‘The keen and constant sight and sense of suffering conspired
         with political enthusiasm’ among framework knitters (Pratt and Neufeldt 1981, pp.46-7),
         but she does not portray the

         perspective of such characters, which Davies encapsulates through Dagley and Sparks
         at the start of scene 4/32.</p>




      <p>Brooke’s self-inflicted political derailment, with his loss of nerve and deviation
         from his prepared speech, is closely represented from the novel as scene 4/32 unfolds.
         Eliot emphasises that Brooke is

         naturally abstemious and so taking a second glass of sherry quickly after the first
         ‘scattered his energies rather than collecting them’ (Ch.51, p.350), and after announcing
         to the crowd how happy he is to

         stand before them the ‘sherry is hurrying like smoke among [his] ideas’ (Ch.51, p.351).
         Davies’ stage direction baldly states, ‘His mind goes completely blank’, and in performance,
         Robert Hardy consciously

         dries. Brooke’s initial speeches to the crowd are littered with the pronouns ‘I’ and
         ‘me’ and his claim to be a ‘close neighbour’ is undermined by his reminder that they
         have ‘known’ him on the bench,

         instantly reinforcing any prejudices about his entitlement. This, coupled with Hardy’s
         'far back' accent, which is at its most pronounced, leads naturally into the mimicking
         of his phrases by the character Vent.</p>




      <p>This childish imitative trick which Eliot refers to as a ‘Punch-voiced echo’ (Ch.51,
         p.352) is coupled with the unveiling of the stuffed effigy of Brooke by Hawley’s cronies.
         Brooke, whom Davies’ stage

         directions note, recovers ‘his senses but not his script’ (SS, p.4/52), then provides
         Vent with all the verbal ammunition he needs to disrupt the crowd and to mock the
         candidate. His ramblings, expertly filleted

         from the novel by Davies, about Pope, Peru, Johnson and the Baltic are lost on his
         audience, even when they are relevant, like his point about the Levant, a market to
         which Middlemarch goods are exported.

         Eliot’s pun on the word ‘bill’ is a gift preserved in the script by Davies as the
         final verbal blow from Vent. Brooke may refer to reform when he promises ‘you shall
         have your Bill, my friends’ but Vent’s

         riposte is that the bill for voting in Brooke will be ‘five thousand pounds and… all
         the beer and bribes accounted for’ (SS, p.4/54).</p>




      <p>Davies’ Vent is a generic, but visually present, character who delivers the message
         of the Tories to the crowd without them being directly incriminated. George Eliot’s
         disembodied voice of Punch makes it even

         more intriguing to the assembled Middlemarch crowd and effectively distances it from
         Hawley. Just as with all other intrigues in Middlemarch, those born and bred are in
         the know. While eggs fly and Bulstrode complains

         that the ‘new police’ are not there to break up the crowd, Standish identifies the
         voice as ‘Bowyer’: ‘I know it as well as if it had been advertised. He’s uncommonly
         good at ventriloquism’ (Ch.51, p.356), and has

         been dining recently with Hawley.</p>




      <p>Significantly, scene 4/32 is bookended first by the hopeful emergence from the White
         Hart of Brooke’s committee and then by their hasty retreat to the hotel shielding
         their humiliated candidate. Davies signals

         in Ladislaw’s dispairing looks through the brief PP 4/32a that all except Brooke fully
         appreciate ‘it’s all up now’ (Ch.51, p.351). In the novel, Eliot leaves this inference
         to ‘the political personage from Brassing’

         who ‘was writing busily, as if he were brewing new devices’ (Ch.51, p.356).</p>

      <p id="comment-240">240. <b>Commentary 29: Scene 4/43</b></p>




      <p>At the beginning of Book 6 of <em>Middlemarch</em>, the widowed Dorothea returns to Lowick with a ‘deep longing…the longing was to see
         Will Ladislaw’ (Ch.54 p.9). When

         he comes to say goodbye (having sensed, the opposition of Dorothea’s family to him,
         and after Brooke’s abandonment of politics and <em>The Pioneer</em>), Dorothea has him

         shown into the drawing-room because it ‘was the most neutral room in the house to
         her’ (Ch.54 p.12).</p>




      <p>The equivalent scene, 4/43 was shot at Brympton d’Evercy, near Yeovil, on Wednesday
         25th August 1993, the penultimate day of filming. It is the same room (adjacent

         to the library) in which they sit when Ladislaw visits Dorothea post-Rome (3/32 –
         filmed the following day), but the set-up here is reversed. This is important. In


         3/32 Dorothea and Ladislaw are seated opposite one another on settees the lighting
         augmenting the natural light from the windows (behind the camera); this is the

         scene in which Ladislaw agrees to stay in Middlemarch. Conversely, in 4/43, where
         Will announces his intention to leave, he and Dorothea remain standing (although

         they are seated in the novel), with the windows and world beyond a continual reminder
         of the transience of this space and their situation. These rooms, forming the

         late 17th century south-facing Baroque wing known as the ‘state apartments’, originally
         constituted a salon on the ground floor opening onto the garden terrace. In

         the early 18th century this long room was divided into ‘the Drawing Room, the following
         room became known as the Oak or Small Drawing Room [library], and the next

         room the Dining Room’ (Wikipedia contributors, 2022 'Brympton d'Evercy'). These three
         interconnected, liminal spaces are clearly established in scene 4/43. Ironically,

         they meet in this central ‘communicating’ room, in which they are unable to communicate
         their feelings for one another.</p>




      <p>The first shot (camera positioned in the library doorway) is of Ladislaw waiting awkwardly,
         putting his hat down on the central table and then nervously picking it

         up. Stage directions in both scripts dictate: ‘He puts his hat on the table. It looks
         silly and incongruous, so he picks it up again. Oh, God, it's left a mark on the

         polished surface (damp with dew). He rubs at the mark. Feels ridiculous. The most
         tragic meeting of his life and here he is messing about with a wet hat' (SS, p.4/69).


         At such crucial moments Davies’ colloquial interpretations of the characters’ emotional
         states are especially candid, and empathetic; Eliot tells us Ladislaw is

         ‘peculiarly uneasy’ (Ch.54 p.13), and Rufus Sewell embodies that particularly well,
         although the intricacies of the hat being wet and the mark on the table are sacrificed

         as perhaps being too extravagantly comic.</p>




      <p>Dorothea enters from the dining-room. Both scripts suggest: ‘She is a bit agitated
         now she is face to face with him. She has never spelt it out to herself, but he

         does make her heart go pit-a-pat’ (SS, p.4/69). In the novel, Dorothea has acknowledged
         to herself her feelings for Will; it is rather the changed circumstances of

         her widowhood that complicate those feelings: ‘Just outside the door she had felt
         that this longed-for meeting was after all too difficult, and when she saw Will

         advancing towards her, the deep blush which was rare in her came with painful suddenness’
         (Ch.54 p.13). In performance Juliet Aubrey does not noticeably blush but

         expresses much of her suppressed emotion through the modulation of her voice rather
         than physically.</p>




      <p>First, when Dorothea praises Will’s plans to go to London, Davies indicates, ‘She's
         trying to be warm and encouraging, but there's something a bit tremulous about

         it. She's going to miss him terribly, and she feels that he doesn't want to go either’
         (SS, p.4/70). The Davies script offers little direction for the next telling

         exchange: LADISLAW [bitterly] ‘You will forget all about me’ (SS, p.4/70). In fact,
         Sewell’s delivery is not bitter so much as a rather pathetic whisper (his little

         boy lost which he plays to such effect in 3/32 when reflecting on his childhood).
         To this Aubrey responds with a warm smile and love in her eyes: ‘I should never

         forget you’. This achieves an open tenderness on both sides that is missing from the
         scene in the novel.</p>




      <p>Secondly, as Davies suggests, ‘This, at last, sounds like the declaration of love
         he's been longing for. But then she spoils it for him,’ by qualifying this with:

         ‘I have never forgotten anyone I used to know’ (SS, p.4/71). This provokes Will’s
         exasperation: ‘Great God!’. He turns away, leaving her out of focus. In the novel
         the

         narrator indicates: ‘It had seemed to him as if they were like two creatures slowly
         turning to marble in each other's presence, while their hearts were conscious and


         their eyes were yearning’ (Ch.54 p.16). Aubrey’s yearning, in performance, is conveyed
         by a move forward into focus again, towards his turned back. The viewer half

         expects her to raise her hand and touch him on the shoulder, but she cannot presume.
         Sewell, throughout this medium close-up, shot-reverse-shot sequence, is framed in

         the doorway of the library, as if Casaubon’s ghostly presence hangs over their meeting.</p>




      <p>Thirdly, Dorothea makes another mistake in offering him the miniature of his grandmother.
         Will’s smart response, ‘Why should I have that when I have nothing else.

         It would be more consoling to me if you wanted to keep it’, seems candid enough: ‘Now
         surely she must realise that he loves her. But are her feelings for him love,

         or just a tender sympathy? Her eyes fill with tears’ (SS, p.4/71). Indeed, Aubrey’s
         tone here seems to suggest the latter, and her eyes scarcely water, although her

         face is held in tighter close-up, suggesting greater intimacy. It still seems to Dorothea
         that his agitation is about the unjust terms of Casaubon’s will rather than

         about his feelings for her.</p>




      <p>Finally, before they are interrupted by Sir James Chettam, Davies reverses the polarity
         of their last exchange, compared with the novel. Davies chooses to end on

         a less intransigent, though equally unresolved, note, by having Dorothea conclude,
         ‘Two years ago I had no notion of the way that trouble comes, and ties our hands

         and makes us silent when we long to speak ...’ to which Davies adds Will’s private
         urging: ‘Speak, speak, please speak, he is willing her. The charged silence is

         interrupted by PRATT knocking and entering’ (SS, p.4/71).</p>




      <p>Although the ebbs and flows of this difficult interchange are managed differently
         between the novel and the final production, the emotional temperature of their

         awkward stand-off is reproduced with palpable credibility.  Following Ladislaw’s formal
         departure, at which Aubrey looks at Sewell utterly bereft, and Dorothea’s

         passionate defence of him to the incredulous Chettam, scene 4/44, a wide shot across
         the garden towards the lake, sees ‘LADISLAW striding away, his stupid hat in his

         hand, he bangs it against his thigh as he walks’ (SS, p.4/74). It is the exact reverse
         of his approach, through the trees, in the establishing scene 4/39. And here,

         as there, the stirring minor colours of bassoon and strings underscore the melodrama
         of the moment. Apart from the hat, he walks away empty-handed.</p>

      <p>The character of Raffles plays a more prominent part in George Eliot’s novel than
         in Andrew Davies’ screenplay. Nonetheless, despite his condensed appearance in the


         adaptation, his plot function is not diminished. Although Raffles is a colourful iconoclast
         in his own right, who serves to ruin Bulstrode’s reputation in Middlemarch,

         he is also one of a number of minor characters who prick the consciences of the established
         elite. These characters themselves range across the social spectrum from Mrs

         Cadwallader and Mr Hawley, to Mr Bambridge the horse-dealer, Mr Mawmsey the grocer,
         and even the Garths. Furthermore, Raffles is a type in Victorian fiction; like the


         ghost of Jacob Marley he disrupts the present order with a visitation from a nefarious
         past. And while Marley is already long dead in Dickens’ story <em>A Christmas Carol</em>

         (1843), Raffles’ involuntary martyrdom, engineered by Bulstrode, precipitates the
         pious banker’s own downfall.</p>




      <p>Popular though such roguish soothsayers may have been with contemporary readers, critical
         opinion, led by Jerome Beaty, is unkind to Eliot here, perhaps with good reason.

         Beaty writes, ‘Rigg and Raffles are the least successful characters in the novel by
         almost common consent. They are incompletely visualised, incompletely presented.

         The coincidences are too many’ (1960, p.75). Without space or necessity to enter into
         an examination of the more elaborate charades of the Bulstrode-Rigg-Raffles plot

         in the novel, their relationship to each other and to Will Ladislaw (the grandson
         of Bulstrode’s first wife whom Raffles has helped Bulstrode deprive of his rightful


         inheritance), it will suffice to say that here the screen adaptor is blessed with
         the opportunity to improve upon the weaknesses of his source material.</p>




      <p>First, Andrew Davies disassociates Joshua Rigg-Featherstone (Raffles’ step-son, who
         in the novel leads Raffles to Bulstrode) from the historical alliance, thus

         simplifying the transactional sale of Stone Court to the Bulstrodes: ‘You've got the
         property, Mr. Bulstrode, and I've got the cash. Both rich men in our way.’

         (PP 4/50, p.4/53). Secondly, Davies omits the complicated (and scarcely credible)
         business of Ladisaw’s inheritance and his relationship to Bulstrode, such that

         Ladislaw never meets with either Bulstrode or Raffles in the dramatisation. Thirdly,
         Raffles on screen is completely visualised and completely presented in John Savident’s


         wonderful rendition of this grotesque Fool - an antiquarian Sir Les Patterson, larger
         than life and twice as uncouth.</p>




      <p>In scene 4/51 Raffles inveigles himself into the parlour at Stone Court, having apprehended
         Bulstrode overlooking the farmlands of his new estate in the company

         of Caleb Garth in the previous scene of the Post-production script, 4/50b. The ‘b’
         indicates that this scene was an addition. In fact, the same encounter occurs in

         the Shooting script immediately following the handover of Stone Court from Rigg to
         Bulstrode in scene 4/50. In the screened version scene 4/50 is split and the two

         occurrences are separated by some distance: the Rigg/Bulstrode deal (4/50a) is put
         back between 4/32a (Brooke’s stoicism following humiliation at the hustings) and

         4/34 (Brooke being laughed at in the street on his way to <em>The Pioneer</em> office to tell Ladislaw he’s stepping down). There then follows 4/60-1 (Rosamond
         and Captain

         Lydgate out riding and Lydgate’s remonstrance), Brooke’s departure from Freshitt (4/36),
         Mrs Cadwallader’s advice to Dorothea on the croquet lawn (4/37-8) and

         Ladislaw’s visit to Dorothea at Lowick (4/43). Then comes 4/50b. This reordering of
         events may well have taken place in the edit suite, in order to balance more

         effectively the four storylines in play and to give a sense of time having elapsed
         between Rigg’s departure and Raffles’ arrival in Middlemarch.</p>




      <p>In the Stone Court parlour, Raffles tucks into his supper and brandy, brought by Mrs
         Abel the housekeeper, while Bulstrode (on tenterhooks) explains to his bemused

         wife that ‘Mr. Raffles has come about a matter of business’, and encourages her off
         to bed as quickly as possible. In the Post-production script Raffles manages

         to drop in an additional barbed comment as she leaves: ‘I could tell you a tale or
         two about old Nick's London days! Goodnight, goodnight!’ (p. 4/74). This is the

         opening gambit of his blackmail mission, complete with reference to the Devil himself,
         and the first intimation of a sordid past. The detail follows swiftly her

         departure: ‘Lots of money in stolen goods, a fine game is the fencing game, and you
         and the old lady ran the best fencing shop in London, eh? Regular thieves

         kitchen! And off to church on Sundays as if butter wouldn't melt...’ It is also revealed
         by Bulstrode that he had paid Raffles to go to America.</p>




      <p>The origins of his bribery emerge in Raffles’ next revelation: ‘I've often thought
         I'd have been better off by telling the first Mrs. B that I'd found her runaway

         daughter. I got very little from you for keeping it quiet - and seeing you take her
         fortune. I've a tender conscience about that pretty daughter. She died penniless,

         but I s'pose you know that?’ (PP, p.4/75). This is rather different from how the matter
         is broached in the Shooting script: ‘All ill-gotten gains, Nick, and none

         of it yours by rights. Oh, he's a clever fellow, old Nicky Bulstrode, he cheated the
         daughter out of her money and let her die destitute while he married the mother

         and got the lot!’ (SS, p.4/88). Interestingly, this alteration implicates Raffles
         more directly in the cover-up, and suggests that Bulstrode may not have been party
         to

         the daughter’s ultimate fate. However, neither here, nor elsewhere in the adaptation,
         is the daughter identified as Ladislaw’s mother. Later, in the Hospital Boardroom


         scene (6/41) for example, Hawley (at his strident best) calls upon Bulstrode to deny
         the charges laid upon him: ‘I don't maintain thieves and cheat offspring of their


         inheritance in order to set myself up as a saintly kill-joy!’ (PP, p.6/47). The matter
         of the offspring cheated of their inheritance (Ladislaw) remains a loose end in

         the adaptation’s plot to the last.</p>




      <p>None the less, Raffles’ tragic tale in 4/51 serves to establish the gravity of Bulstrode’s
         crimes, and the corrosiveness of his Christian guilt. He warns Raffles in

         this scene, ‘You will do well to reflect that it's possible for a man to overreach
         himself in his efforts to secure undue advantage’, to which Raffles smartly retorts:


         ‘Well, you'd know all about that, Nick’ (SS, p.4/87). Davies reinforces this irony
         by allowing Raffles’ swift riposte, while in the novel Bulstrode’s speech continues


         uninterrupted: ‘Although I am not in any way bound to you, I am willing to supply
         you with a regular annuity…’ (Ch.53, p.390).</p>




      <p>But while Bulstrode’s conscience is an easy target for the self-serving Raffles, Eliot’s
         narrator, characteristically, adopts a more temperate perspective. In the

         unravelling of Bulstrode’s historic deceit we are told, "If this be hypocrisy, it
         is a process which shows itself occasionally in us all" (Ch.61, p.132). ‘Thus,’

         for Will Glovinsky, ‘there remain two Bulstrodes: one serving as the narratively necessary
         foil to Dorothea's imperfect virtue, the other as synecdoche of "us all"’

         (2022, p.424). The other significant alteration between Shooting script and final
         production is the deferral of Raffles’ immediate demands for payment until the next


         morning (4/56), keeping Bulstrode on tenterhooks and on his knees that night in fervent
         prayer (4/54). Instead, as 4/51 concludes, Raffles gorges himself on Bulstrode’s

         brandy, as if to remind the banker that it is because of their enduring pact that
         he can afford to drink so well.</p>

      <p id="comment-250">250. <b>Commentary 31: Scene 5/9</b></p>




      <p>It is not known how different the versions of the last three episodes that Louis Marks
         (producer) and Susie Chapman (script editor) proposed were from Andrew Davies’ own,


         but it is clear from the Post-production script that the final dramatisation altered
         the emphasis of Episode 5 away from the Lydgates’ failing fortunes (in money and marriage)


         to the upward trajectory of the Fred and Mary sub-plot.</p>




      <p>Episode 5 eschews the trials of the Lydgates, with which Episode 4 ended (Rosy’s miscarriage)
         and which the Shooting script continued (Spooner’s credit (5/4), gossip on the

         street (5/5-5/6) and in the Green Dragon (5/7), and conflict at home (5/8)). It opens
         instead with Fred Vincy’s speculative visit to Rev Farebrother, who is moving in at
         Lowick

         Rectory, for advice (PP 5/9). Fred, newly-graduated from college, is resistant to
         the expectation that he will take holy orders. Farebrother initially thinks Fred wants
         moral

         guidance from a man of the cloth (who is an unconventional parson in his own way).
         But it emerges that Fred’s antipathy is not simply that he would rather be a farmer,
         but that

         Mary will not have him if he becomes a clergyman. Fred’s real motive is not moral
         guidance therefore, but to entreat Farebrother to petition Mary on his behalf to elicit
         the

         strength of her feelings, if he should choose another path. This, as Mrs Garth later
         informs him (5/45) ‘was a mistake’. It is doubly insulting to Farebrother. Firstly,
         Fred

         disparages the life of a clergyman (which Farebrother himself took up reluctantly).
         And secondly, he fails to divine Farebrother’s own regard for Mary. In agreeing to
         act as Fred’s

         emissary, Farebrother shows the same, self-effacing moral rectitude as he does when
         Lydgate votes against him in the hospital chaplaincy election, and hubristically ignores
         his

         advice about how to handle Middlemarchers.</p>




      <p>The Garths and the Farebrothers form the undemonstrative and unselfish moral axis
         of Middlemarch in many respects, and it is productive (both in the novel and the adaptation)


         that their actions and values impinge upon the unstable foundations of the main relationships
         at this juncture in the unfolding of events. They impact upon the Lydgates, Fred,


         Bulstrode and even Dorothea and Ladislaw (indirectly).</p>




      <p>Whilst the dialogue is little altered, there are a number of scenic changes between
         the Shooting script and Post-production script here. In the former Fred arrives on
         foot,

         Farebrother is indoors unpacking books. In the latter, Fred is on horseback (his favoured
         mode of transport) and Farebrother is met outside the parsonage, directing removals;


         their conversation is conducted among the gravestones of the churchyard. It is likely
         that the changes were to accommodate both the exterior possibilities of the location
         at

         Brympton d’Evercy and its interior limitations. Brympton’s fifteenth-century ‘Priest
         House’ (now called the Castle House), lies south of the main house and adjacent to
         St. Andrew’s

         Church. Although we only see this building from the outside, it makes for a plausible
         parsonage, though the novel suggests that the church and living are at some further
         remove from

         the manor house at Lowick.</p>




      <p>What relocating the conversation to the churchyard also provides is a symbolic setting
         that enables Anthony Page (director) to bring out something of the relative masculine


         power relations of Mary’s rival suitors. This is the first time they have discussed
         her together. In the stage directions Farebrother ‘sits down on a stone slab, takes
         off his hat

         and runs his fingers through his hair’ (PP, p.5/5). This is a nervous response which
         suggests the physical weakness of the older man despite his superior wisdom. Fred,
         by contrast,

         remains standing over Farebrother and irreverently, raises one booted leg atop the
         monumental slab, showing that what he may lack in sense he makes up for in youthful
         virility. Fred’s

         desire to ride across country and do what other men do (rather than be a clergyman)
         demeans Farebrother’s vocation, and Fred’s overbearing physical stance completes his
         emasculation.

         As the stage directions impart, ‘he's feeling used’ by Fred and his tone indicates
         he is affronted. Fred, sensing he may have overstepped the mark, invokes pathos in
         his final plea:

         ‘I don't know how I could live without the hope of her ... it would be like learning
         to live with wooden legs. Please... speak to her for me’. Thus, Fred substitutes his
         muscular,

         riding-booted leg with the imaginative simile of an artificial one. The image is George
         Eliot’s, but its symbolism here is empowered by the staging. And over Fred’s plea,
         Mary’s

         pastoral recorder theme plays, softening both men’s hearts. Farebrother relents: ‘He
         knows he's going to have to do it’ (PP, p.5/6).</p>


      <p>By contrast, in Chapter 52 of the novel, Fred visits Farebrother at home before his
         move to Lowick; he is packing rather than unpacking, and has recently been on the
         receiving

         end of much encouragement from his aunt and mother (and especially his sister ‘Winny’)
         to marry (Mary Garth) now he has gained the living. Conveniently, Mary Garth is already
         installed

         as their housemaid at the parsonage, making her on hand and alone when Farebrother
         delivers his commission. Therefore, the novel makes both the possibility of a romance
         between

         Farebrother and Mary more openly discussed, and their proximity more encouraging to
         that possibility (and discouraging to Fred). However, it also facilitates the Parson’s
         further altruism

         in engineering time and space for Fred and Mary to be alone when he plucks up courage
         (after Farebrother’s intervention) to visit her at Lowick. In the adaptation, Mary
         returns home

         after Featherstone’s death and Garth’s new position as land agent for Freshitt and
         Tipton ensures they are, as Mrs Garth tells Farebrother, ‘rich enough to educate Alfred
         and to keep

         Mary at home’ (SS, 3/54). In this way, both Farebrother’s and afterwards Fred’s visits
         to Mary are on the Garths’ home soil (in the fecund environs of the orchard).</p>


      <p>Fred Vincy’s ‘coming of age’ and finding his way (which is the one positive plot-line
         anchoring Episode 5) is the result of support from Farebrother, Garth, Mary and, grudgingly,


         his own father, before Bulstrode’s provision of Stone Court (out of guilt) finally
         secures his marriage and future (in Episode 6). In some ways it is remarkable that
         the new

         class of businessman Vincy represents is unable to employ his eldest son (which was
         common). But it is precisely the precarity of their socio-economic elevation (in hock
         to

         Bulstrode), that makes the succession of Fred (in business) and Rosamond (by marriage)
         both needful and risky. Jonathan Firth brought a quality to Fred which Andrew Davies


         identified in interview as ‘a bit grumpy and resentful’ (Davies 2022, p.5). But the
         chip on his shoulder, which Firth carries so well, may be seen as a function of

         Fred’s economic insecurity as well as his personal fecklessness.</p>

      <p>Davies’ adaptation in these two scenes of the conversation at Freshitt, where Mrs
         Cadwallader advises Dorothea against meeting Ladislaw again, is particularly intriguing.
         It at once

         celebrates the heritage setting of the English country house and displays all the
         self-centred and hypocritical entitlement of the characters who dwell there. This
         is Davies at his most playful

         in conveying the ideas that Dorothea contests with her peers and elders.</p>




      <p>This duality becomes evident in the opening lines of scene 5/27 as Chettam (Julian
         Wadham) expresses his disgust that Ladislaw is still in Middlemarch - something he
         views as a danger to

         Dorothea’s reputation. Although Davies takes much of the dialogue verbatim from the
         novel, Mrs Cadwallader’s ‘joke’ about it not yet being a crime to be a foreigner is
         all the screenwriter’s. (The

         only character in the novel to label Ladislaw of ‘foreign extraction’ is the minor
         character Hackbutt, around the time of Will’s appointment at <em>The Pioneer</em> (Ch.37, p.129), although Farebrother

         and Hawley do problematically discuss Will’s ‘queer genealogy’ (Ch.71, p.285) when
         Bulstrode’s past starts to emerge). The fact that Chettam takes Mrs Cadwallader’s
         comment as a joke and that it

         is accepted into the script is a sign both of Middlemarch’s aversion to ‘outsiders’
         and of how far UK society has since come in terms of diversity criteria for television
         output.</p>




      <p>Chettam successfully intimates to Mrs Cadwallader (Elizabeth Spriggs) the challenge
         he faces in talking to Dorothea about Ladislaw. The viewer has seen how she countered
         Chettam when he interrupted

         her previous encounter with Ladislaw at Lowick (scene 4/43) and, as her brother-in-law,
         he does not want to risk marring their family relationship. But the sub-text is that
         in addressing the topic

         with Dorothea he might come across as jealous. The adaptation quotes directly from
         the novel with Chettam’s line that any advice ‘will come more lightly from’ Mrs Cadwallader
         (Ch.62, p.145).</p>




      <p>This rather insidious dialogue takes place against the backdrop of an idealised English
         country house (Walcot Hall, Shropshire) with its imposing façade and generous lawns
         upon which Celia is

         strolling with the Nanny, baby Arthur in her arms, and Dorothea is walking with two
         English setters. The trap is set for Dorothea as she wanders, out of focus, into the
         two-shot of Chettam and

         Cadwallader just as the latter has agreed to offer her advice and cries, ‘Oh, I hear
         you’re going to Tipton, my dear’. Dorothea stops still, framed between them, and then
         the camera brings her

         into focus. She has sprung their trap.</p>




      <p>This is all very different from how it happens in the novel, where Dorothea is detained
         at Freshitt by a meeting with Caleb Garth and is then invited to walk down the gravel
         path with Chettam and

         Cadwallader. It is in this setting that Mrs Cadwallader begins her verbal diatribe
         against Ladislaw still being in Middlemarch when it was reported he was to leave weeks
         earlier and talks of him ‘warbling at

         the piano’ with Mrs Lydgate or ‘lying on the rug’.  Dorothea issues a similar retort
         to the one in Davies’ dialogue: ‘You began by saying one report was false… I believe
         this one is too, (Ch.62, p.146),

         which threatens to derail Mrs Cadwallader’s argument. The older woman however, recovers
         herself enough to reply, ‘Heaven grant it… I mean that all bad tales be untrue’. This
         is a back-handed way of

         saying that they will not all prove to be untrue but with the ’I mean’ she makes it
         clear that she is not echoing Dorothea’s last comment that Ladislaw has ‘already suffered
         too much injustice’. This

         double slight is a provocation that the young Dorothea cannot stand and she exits
         unceremoniously on her own by carriage to Tipton, leaving Chettam, who has remained
         silent for the duration, repenting

         ‘of his stratagem’ (Ch.62, p.147).</p>




      <p>Davies’ Dorothea is not so lucky to escape; it is not until Mrs Cadwallader has her
         in the confines of the carriage (in scene 5/28), having bagged a drive to Tipton,
         that she begins with her advice about ‘Young Mr.

         Ladislaw’. The gulf between them, implied metaphorically in the two shot which places
         them either side of the Freshitt driveway with the house still visible, widens as
         their conversation continues.

         Dorothea looks away from her companion until she mentions Ladislaw’s visits with Rosamond
         and then, contrasting with Mrs Cadwallader’s slow drawl, she delivers her defence
         of him with pace, emotion and sentiment

         that echo the feelings that the novel’s narrator attributes to her:</p>

      Dorothea when thoroughly moved cared little what any one thought of her feelings;

      and even if she had been able to reflect, she would have held it petty to keep silence
      at

      injurious words about Will from fear of being herself misunderstood (Ch.62, pp.146-7).




      <p>As in other scenes, the extremities of emotion with which Eliot endows in her teenage
         protagonist are often downplayed both in Davies’ script and in the more mature performance
         of Aubrey.</p>




      <p>The account of Will ‘lying on the rug’ is surely a euphemism for physical intimacy
         and the seed of this image is sown much earlier in the narrator’s comment that ‘the
         house where he visited oftenest

         and lay most on the rug was Lydgate’s’ (Ch.46. p.289). Ironically, of course Dorothea
         is right and in Ladislaw’s eyes this merely a Romantic pose showing he is at ease
         in a friend’s house. Indeed,

         Lydgate himself does not raise an eyebrow when Ladislaw lies there on the rug in his
         presence along with ‘the house spaniel’. But the insinuation from Mrs Cadwallader
         really affects Dorothea, partly

         because such behaviour would be considered outlandish by her immediate peers.</p>




      <p>Mrs Cadwallader’s snobbishness about the ‘disreputable’ people of ‘manufacturing towns’
         has its origins in the novel as does her disappointed tone about Lydgate’s choice
         of wife when after all,

         ‘Wasn’t he the son of somebody?’ This is immediately followed by Mrs Cadwallader catching
         Dorothea’s eye as she delivers her generalisation that ‘one cannot be wise for other
         people’ (SS 5/28). The implication is,

         of course, that Dorothea could make the same unforgiveable mistake if she chooses
         to ruin her reputation and seek Ladislaw as her partner. An obvious irony is that
         this is exactly what Mrs Cadwallader

         has done herself. She fell for the Reverend Cadwallader and married beneath her birth
         status. Davies chooses not to include this sub-plot in his adaptation or to ever introduce
         viewers to the Reverend,

         but readers of the novel will see the ultimate hypocrisy of Mrs Cadwallader in these
         comments.</p>




      <p>Towards the end of scene 5/28, Mrs Cadwallader backs off for a few moments to give
         her advice time to sink in – instead talking about the perversity of ‘we English’
         in persevering with ‘open carriages’.

         The viewer might wish this was the worst of habits of ‘the English’ upper classes
         that these scenes had revealed. It is no accident that Dorothea falls silent at this
         point and the minor key theme of raging

         strings takes off. In interview, Davies discusses how initially he tried to write
         out Mrs Cadwallader altogether on the grounds that she does not carry any significant
         plot but soon reneged on this because

         quite simply ‘she’s got some of the best lines’ in the novel (Davies 1993, p.116)
         and indeed in scenes like 1/64 proves to be a useful surrogate narrator/social commentator.</p>




      <p>It is here that 5/28 ends in the Shooting script. However, in the Post-production
         script, as the carriage rounds the corner of the drive to follow the Freshitt estate
         boundary wall, Mrs Cadwallader renews

         her onslaught. This time, in voiceover, she warns more openly that ‘it would be scandalous
         if you received him’ (PP 5/28), echoing her comment earlier in the novel to Chettam
         that Ladislaw is ‘making a

         dark-blue scandal’ (Ch.62, p.146) at the Lydgates. Her voice trails off but this leaves
         the viewer in no doubt that the journey will be tortuous for Dorothea.</p>

      <p id="comment-260">260. <b>Commentary 33: Scenes 5/31-5/33</b></p>




      <p>In the sequence of private encounters between Ladislaw and Dorothea, scene 5/31 marks
         the climax of their melodrama’s emotional contortion. It is also another example

         of Andrew Davies’ techniques of excision and compression and his dramatic structuring
         through progressive repetition. In the Post-production script the scene is presented
         as

         a chance meeting, at Tipton (in Brooke’s absence). In the Shooting script, Ladislaw
         is there apparently to retrieve ‘a portfolio of sketches’ before his final departure
         (SS,

         p.5/50). Dorothea tells the housekeeper, Mrs Kell, in the previous short establishing
         scene (SS 5/29), ‘I've just come to pick up some documents’ (SS, p.5/49). In the

         Post-production script she says simply, ‘Uncle's asked me to sort a few things out
         for him’ (PP, p.5/33). Yet on meeting, Ladislaw says, ‘I wrote to you - I am going
         away

         immediately, and I could not go without speaking to you again’ (SS, p.5/50). The word
         ‘today’ is inserted after ‘I wrote to you’ in the final version of this speech. The


         viewer is led to believe, therefore, that Ladislaw has requested this meeting in his
         letter.</p>




      <p>In Chapter 62 of the novel, Ladislaw sends the letter proposing to call at Lowick,
         and is awaiting a reply; Dorothea has yet to receive this missive before her Tipton
         visit

         to write some memoranda for her uncle. In the Shooting script there is a short scene
         (SS 5/26) which sees Ladislaw still at <em>The Pioneer</em> writing the letter: ‘My dear Mrs. Casaubon.

         I hesitate to communicate with you again, but I should be very grateful if you would
         consent to one last brief meeting. I have to collect certain papers from Tipton Grange
         this

         afternoon, but perhaps I might be allowed to call at Lowick briefly tomorrow evening’
         (SS, p.5/45). The Production schedule confirms that this scene was shot (on Sunday
         11th July

         1993) but evidently did not make the final cut. Therefore, this scene does not appear
         in the Post-production script. Either way, Dorothea does not get the letter.</p>




      <p>As it is, they meet by chance at Tipton, though it is chance informed by intention
         and mutual desire. So what is George Eliot’s purpose in the letter that is never read?
         And what

         of the changes between Davies’ Shooting script and the final production which favours
         coincidence over intention? In the first place, Will’s letter is an act of resolution
         informed

         by the new knowledge he has both of Casaubon’s codicil (which he learns from Rosamond)
         and, in the novel, his mother’s disinheritance (acquired from encounters with Raffles
         and

         Bulstrode). Yet he ‘felt the awkwardness of asking for more last words’ with Dorothea,
         since ‘a first farewell has pathos in it, but to come back for a second lends an opening
         to

         comedy’ (Ch. 62, pp.142-3). The reader knows in advance, that he is driven by both
         passion and the defence of his own integrity, to overcome his embarrassment.</p>




      <p>He adopts a direct approach (the letter), rather ‘than to use any device which might
         give an air of chance to a meeting of which he wished her to understand that it was
         what he

         earnestly sought’ (Ch.62, p.143). Why then, does it come down to chance, in the event?
         The answer perhaps, lies as much with Dorothea as with Will. Had Dorothea received
         Will’s letter,

         her consent to a final meeting might have been tantamount to an act of devotion on
         the one hand, but it would also have been an act of defiance (of Chettam and Mrs Cadwallader)
         on the

         other. As she drives alone from Freshitt to Tipton, with their recent blackening of
         Will’s character (vis a vis Rosamond) reducing her to private tears, she felt ‘a strange
         alternation

         between anger with Will and the passionate defence of him’ (Ch. 62, p.148). In this
         state of mind, it is crucial that their encounter is circumstantial and perhaps destined.
         In both the

         novel and the adaptation, Ladislaw’s first words are about his unseen letter, turning
         chance back to purpose. In the adaptation, however, she travels to Tipton with Mrs
         Cadwallader as

         chaperone (continuing to besmirch Ladislaw, sotto-voce, on the way). Judging by her
         facial expressions Dorothea is moved but resilient. Certainly, there is no sign of
         tears.</p>




      <p>It is Ladislaw who is impassioned in this brief encounter: ‘What I care for more than
         I can ever care for anything else is absolutely forbidden me’. Davies uses Eliot’s
         dialogue verbatim,

         but the speech is truncated. In the novel he goes on to say: ‘I don't mean merely
         by being out of my reach, but forbidden me, even if it were within my reach, by my
         own pride and honour— by

         everything I respect for myself’ (Ch.62, p.153). This is an important idea which is
         lost in the adaptation; perhaps it would be lost on a modern audience too.</p>




      <p>The simple choreography of shot-reverse-shot which frames each actor individually
         and never together, turns on the point where Ladislaw fastens his bag and says, with
         finality, ‘I must go’.

         He crosses before the camera and the scene is concluded in reverse. Dorothea is left
         stunned by their last exchange when her entreaty to ‘remember me’ is answered ‘almost
         savagely’ with: ‘As

         if I were not in danger of forgetting everything else’. In the Shooting script they
         were to have been interrupted by Mrs Kell. And the stage directions there suggest:
         ‘She takes his hand. He

         holds hers for a moment. He feels terrible. He is going to have to let go for ever
         and never touch her again’ (SS, p.5/53). There is no physical connection between them
         in the scene as played,

         and Ladislaw is notably colder. The camera lingers for a while on a close-up of Dorothea’s
         perplexity, her darting eyes doing the thinking. Davies’ stage direction, which doesn’t
         appear in the

         Post-production script, puts it with customary candour: she ‘realises now, that it
         is her he's crazy about, not Rosy’. We cut to a country road with the stagecoach carrying
         Ladislaw away.

         </p>




      <p>In the novel Dorothea’s epiphany is expressed in terms which are perhaps as alien
         to a television audience of the 1990s as Ladislaw’s hurt pride. ‘Dorothea drew a deep
         breath and felt her

         strength return — she could think of him unrestrainedly. At that moment the parting
         was easy to bear: the first sense of loving and being loved excluded sorrow’ (Ch.62,
         p.156). She is overjoyed

         because, ‘He had acted so as to defy reproach, and make wonder respectful.’  Destined
         or not, this is unadulterated melodrama, because it celebrates a love which is renounced
         as pure and

         unimpeachable. A brief encounter indeed.</p>


      <hr>






      <p id="comment-265">265. <b>Commentary 34: Scenes 5/15-5/20</b></p>




      <p>In this sequence of five short scenes, lasting only four and a half minutes on screen,
         Andrew Davies adapts an episode from Chapter 56 of the novel, where George Eliot uses
         a seemingly random act

         of aggression among minor characters to advance the Fred Vincy quest for a purpose
         plot. However, this scene also offers an opportunity to explore the wider historical
         context from the perspective of

         a farmworker who views the effects of industrial change – the coming of the railway
         - with scepticism for the lot of the working man.</p>




      <p>More unusually for Davies, the screenwriter adheres strongly to the order and detail
         of events in the 10 pages of the novel, where Eliot outlines the way Fred comes across
         the scene near Yoddrell’s

         farm where the haymakers are about to confront the railway surveyors. Scene 5/15 introduces
         Garth and Tom his assistant measuring out land that Dorothea plans to sell off and
         about which in the novel

         Eliot’s narrator reveals Garth’s ‘bias was towards getting the best possible terms
         from railroad companies’ (Ch.56, p.35). In the Post-production script, scene 5/16
         sees Fred on horseback charging

         down to intervene in the fracas; in scene 5/17 Tom is knocked out by the farmworkers;
         scene 5/18 shows Fred halting his horse between the farmers and the fleeing railway
         men; scene 5/19 has Fred

         checking on Garth and Tom and the longer scene 5/20 is where Garth first talks with
         the farmworkers and then with Fred, leading to the plan for Fred to have a trial working
         for him.</p>




      <p>This is a slightly streamlined flow of events compared with the Shooting script, where
         scene 5/15 contains more dialogue between Tom and Garth about the technicalities of
         measuring out the land.

         This detail is replaced in the Post-production script with Hiram Ford’s threats to
         the surveyors to ‘Go cut up land in another parish!’, initiating the momentum for
         this action scene and establishing

         this character as the principal agitator. In the Shooting script Caleb Garth’s intervention
         is more active than in the onscreen version in scene 5/17 and generally he has fewer
         lines across the whole

         sequence than Davies originally scripts. Clive Russell’s physical bearing and calming
         aura successfully conveys Garth thoughts in performance without the need for some
         of the original dialogue. Fred

         may play the young squire in both versions of scene 5/18 but his language and threats
         to see the farmworkers ‘transported’ are toned down from the novel where he offers
         to see them ‘Hung at the next

         assizes’. Even Eliot’s Fred seems to recognize that he has performed a stereotypical
         lord-like act in this scenario though, when he ‘afterwards laughed heartily at his
         own phrases’ (Ch.56, p.37).

         </p>




      <p>Fred’s salutary warning of transportation may stop the belligerent Hiram Ford in his
         tracks but Davies, consciously removes the rashest move of Fred’s in responding to
         Hiram’s challenge to a personal

         fight, if he will only get down from his horse. In the novel, Fred says he will come
         back and help Garth for the day, ‘Only I want to go first and have a round with that
         hulky fellow who turned to challenge

         me’ (Ch.56, p.38-9). He is dissuaded from this by Caleb and although Fred offers to
         go and talk to the workers with Caleb in the Shooting script in scene 5/19, the older
         man refuses the help of his ‘young

         blood’, the implication being he might be too hot-headed (SS, p.5/32). This is perhaps
         a signal that for Davies, Fred’s rehabilitation starts here.</p>




      <p>In the novel as Garth approaches the farmworkers, he has mixed feelings ‘having always
         been a hard-working man himself—of rigorous notions about workmen and practical indulgence
         towards them’ but

         reluctantly feels he must give them a ‘little harangue’ (Ch.56, p.39). The irony is
         that when he addresses them to defend the coming of the railway as a good thing’ he
         is held up by Timothy Cooper as ‘being

         for the big folks’. Davies retains this line in the script but instead of Garth replying
         ‘If you don't think well of me, Tim, never mind’ (Ch 56, p.41), Clive Russell, takes
         the comment as if a dose of

         medicine and accepts the farmer’s apology which follows swiftly.</p>




      <p>Timothy Cooper is described in Davies’ stage directions as the workers’ ‘moral leader’
         even if Hiram Ford is their ‘employer’ (SS 5/20, p.534. It is this everyman character
         who, as in the novel, gives

         the long view of the rural workforce – they have experienced ‘war’, ‘peace’ and the
         coming of the ‘canells’ and none of these have brought them any greater prosperity
         or change of status. In the adaptation,

         his speech is an extrapolation of Ford’s sneering reaction to Garth’s suggestion that
         they ‘Live and let live’ – a rather modern phrase for Davies to have added to the
         dialogue. To these rural workers it is

         always they who are required to ‘Live and let live’, not their betters.</p>




      <p>Following the successful dissipation of the fight, Garth comments ‘that’s my day’s
         work gone’ (SS 5/20, p.5/32), which prompts Fred’s offer to help him. This offer comes
         much earlier in the novel – before

         Caleb goes to speak with the ruffians. And the suggestion comes not from Fred but
         from Garth himself. This strand of the plot is all tidied into 5/20 in the script,
         lest the audience will have forgotten Fred’s

         offer of help during the intervening debate with the farmworkers. In scene 5/20 as
         the two walk uphill, away from the railway men resuming their survey, their dialogue
         is much filleted from the longer

         conversation in Chapter 56 which takes place over the whole day they spend outdoors
         together. There Garth holds forth on the importance of loving ‘your work, and not
         be always looking over the edge of it,

         wanting your play to begin’ (p.43). He expresses a genuine interest in Fred’s future
         and is pleased at his desire to enter his own trade. Davies perhaps missed an opportunity
         by showing Fred at work with Garth,

         getting his hands (and his clothes) dirty and bonding with Garth as they measure the
         land together.  It is a crucial moment where Fred, who is struggling to find his role
         in life but does not want to accept the

         role of clergyman which Vincy has chosen for him, begins to find his way.</p>




      <p>In the novel Garth seems keen to consult with Susan about Fred working for him but
         before he arrives home he has ‘taken his resolution’ to pursue the idea. Davies is
         careful in his script to retain Garth’s

         general guiding principle from the novel – that ‘the young ones always have a claim
         on the old to help them forward’ (PP 5/20, p.53). But it is also clear from Clive
         Russell’s demeanour that Garth feels he has

         an extra responsibility to Fred if this lad wants to ‘take Mary’s happiness’ into
         his ‘keeping’ (Ch.56, p.44).</p>




      <p>The shooting of this complicated sequence over two days (31st July and 1st August
         1993), required Lighting cameraman Brian Tufano, unusually, to produce storyboards
         ‘to make it absolutely clear to everybody

         involved exactly what the director [Anthony Page] had in mind’, and to help ‘the director
         to visualise the set-ups he would need to tell the story’ (Tufano 1993, p.31). The
         camera ranges from the wide angle of

         high vantage points of both Fred and Garth on the banks either side of the track through
         the valley where the fight takes place to the shot-reverse shot of the conversation
         between Garth and the farmworkers

         after the fight. Also most effective in the encounter between Fred and Ford are the
         circling shots of Fred on horseback and Ford beneath him trying to avoid the hooves.
         Tufano orchestrates this variety of shots

         to create the closest experience to an action sequence that the viewer will have in
         <em>Middlemarch</em>. However,  the fight itself also prompted one of the funnier moments that occurred
         during the shoot, as Script

         editor Susie Conklin recalls:</p>

      there was no real fight, right?… but they had to hire stuntmen to be the locals…

      The lead stunt guy had just finished doing a <em>Bond</em> film… So they go to costume and they

      get their farmer/local stuff on and were like, “Okay, what are we doing?” Anthony
      starts (laughs)

      to tell them the history of the railway and… (laughter). They’re standing there with
      pitchforks

      going, “Right, so what do you want?”… They must have just thought we were all mad
      with our

      attempt at doing a heavy action scene in a period drama (Conklin 1993, p.13).

      <p id="comment-270">270. <b>Commentary 35: Scenes 5/45-5/46</b></p>




      <p>The enlightenment of Fred Vincy continues in two scenes which complete the chain of
         events he set in motion in enlisting Rev Farebrother’s help at the start of Episode
         5. In the first, Fred is

         tested and found wanting by Mrs Garth, in failing to recognise and respect Farebrother’s
         affection for Mary. In the second, he is teased by both Farebrother and Mary before
         her affection for him

         is confirmed.</p>




      <p>5/45 is a triumph both of Andrew Davies’ adaptive economy and Gabrielle Lloyd’s measured
         performance as Mrs Garth. Apart from the removal of Ben and Letty, the younger Garth
         children, the Shooting

         script was filmed as written. However, in Chapter 57 of the novel the dialogue between
         Fred and his future mother-in-law is punctuated with significant narrative commentary
         on Mrs Garth’s emotional state:

         ‘The power of admonition which had begun to stir in Mrs Garth had not yet discharged
         itself. It was a little too provoking even for her self-control that this blooming
         youngster should flourish on the

         disappointments of sadder and wiser people—making a meal of a nightingale and never
         knowing it—and that all the while his family should suppose that hers was in eager
         need of this sprig; and her vexation

         had fermented the more actively because of its total repression towards her husband.
         Exemplary wives will sometimes find scapegoats in this way’ (Ch.57, pp. 61-2). This
         is strong stuff, difficult to convey

         in performance. Yet on screen Lloyd manages to bring out much of Mrs Garth’s changing
         disposition, and to embody perfectly Eliot’s observation that ‘while her grammar and
         accent were above the town standard,

         she wore a plain cap, cooked the family dinner, and darned all the stockings’ (Ch.24,
         p.370). The mise-en-scène here plays a significant visual function too.</p>




      <p>Fred enters the parlour, having finished his day’s work with Garth, apparently without
         motive; in the novel, he deliberately calls on Mrs Garth ‘to assure himself that she
         accepted their new relations

         willingly’ (Ch.57, p.57).  In 5/45 she is enjoying a letter from Alfred (informing
         her he has won a prize as best apprentice); in the novel it is the bookish Christy
         (home from college) who is the ‘incorporate

         criticism on poor Fred, a sort of object-lesson given to him by the educational mother’
         (Ch.57, p.58). In the adaptation, Mrs Garth puts aside her letter and takes up her
         needlework. Rather sheepishly,

         Fred seats himself and begins pleading his own cause by citing the faith shown in
         him by her husband, Farebrother and Mary. The shot-reverse-shot exchange gives way
         to a brief two-shot across the table at

         which they are seated on opposite sides, with the backdrop of the fireplace and mantleshelf
         framing them. There is a merry blaze in the grate, fresh herbs and flowers hanging
         in front to dry, what looks

         like an apprentice-piece on the shelf above, a simple pewter candlestick and a jug
         of roses. This straightforward home, this open hearth, is what is at stake between
         them, and what Mrs Garth is defending.</p>




      <p>Absorbed in her work, Mrs Garth’s responses to Fred’s self-promotion are curt. We
         cut back to her in close-up, she looks up at him directly over the rims of her spectacles:
         ‘You made a mistake in asking Mr.

         Farebrother to speak for you’. Fred’s failure to recognize Farebrother’s interest
         in Mary is underlined by her next admonishment: ‘Yes, young people are usually blind
         to everything but their own wishes’. And,

         as the penny drops with Fred her next reply is brusque: ‘If it were so, Fred, I think
         you are the last person who ought to be astonished’ (PP, p.5/65). Though Mrs Garth
         (here), like Farebrother (in 5/9), commands

         the moral high ground, our focus is on Fred’s education. Having endured Mrs Garth’s
         opprobrium, he is allowed to pass this gatekeeper and encounter Mary and Farebrother
         in the orchard, disarmed but not dissuaded

         by his new knowledge.</p>




      <p>In the novel, Fred visits Mrs Garth (at home) on his way to see Mary (at Lowick parsonage).
         There, he finds Mary entangled in conversation with the three ladies of the household:
         ‘They were in animated discussion

         on some subject which was dropped when he entered’ (Ch.57, p.66). Mary has to defend
         her antipathy towards clergymen ‘except the Vicar of Wakefield and Mr Farebrother’
         (p.66), while Fred is marooned. Farebrother is

         out, ‘somewhere in the village’ (p.66), but returns in time to engineer Fred and Mary’s
         removal from the company of the ladies to his study, where he, in turn, leaves them
         both alone. In the dialogue which follows,

         Fred pours out his jealousy while Mary is non-plussed by Fred’s insistence about Farebrother’s
         romantic intentions. She reassures him, yet on Farebrother’s return, ‘Fred had to
         return to the drawing-room still with a

         jealous dread in his heart, but yet with comforting arguments from Mary's words and
         manner. The result of the conversation was on the whole more painful to Mary: inevitably
         her attention had taken a new attitude, and

         she saw the possibility of new interpretations’ (p.70). This possibility is already
         closed off in the adaptation, since in scene 5/11 where Farebrother visits Mary as
         emissary for Fred, she clearly recognizes the vicar’s

         personal interest in her and politely declines it; the on-screen Mary is altogether
         more savvy.</p>




      <p>This difference, in turn, plays into the romantic setting of the orchard (5/46), where
         Fred discovers Mary (on a swing) and Farebrother (seated at her feet) laughing together;
         they play on his jealousy before

         Farebrother gallantly leaves them alone. Fred continues to bemoan the rival with whom
         he can’t compete until Mary, playfully, settles the matter. The stage directions conclude:
         ‘to his amazement, she gives him a brief

         but emphatic kiss on the mouth, and runs off to the house, laughing, leaving him gobsmacked’
         (PP, p.5/67). This is both a more modern rendition of Mary’s character and a more
         emphatic resolution of their courtship than

         the novel affords in Chapter 57. It is also another scene which ends with Andrew Davies’
         favoured technique of dramatic upstaging, leaving a central protagonist dumb-struck
         (as previously noted with Lydgate (1/74) and

         Brooke (4/23)).</p>




      <p>There are two conclusions to be drawn about the emphasis that the dramatisation places
         upon Farebrother’s magnanimity and Mary’s candour. These traits are not inconsistent
         with their portrayals in the novel, but are

         certainly amplified in the adaptation. One is simply that the upheavals which take
         place in Episode 5 (Ladislaw’s ultimate estrangement from Dorothea, the Lydgates’
         mounting debts and failing marriage, Raffles’

         exposure of Bulstrode) require a dramatic corrective which is provided by the positive
         trajectory and resolution of the Fred and Mary sub-plot. Fred is the prodigal (or
         at least feckless) son reformed by the altruistic

         guidance of Farebrother, Garth and Mary herself.  But this salvation narrative is
         reinforced by a second aspect. Nicole M. Coonradt, in a trenchant focus on Mary’s
         role (as Eliot’s only female author), cites Bernard J.

         Paris who views ‘Mary and her family as "foil[s] to the egoists" the variously self-centered
         characters with whom much of the action of the novel concerns itself’ (2012: 24).
         Coonradt reminds us that the Garths are

         Eliot’s only unimpeachable family: ‘They are hard- working, honest, fair, compassionate,
         humble, and never prone to gossip’ (2012: 18). Those selfless guides who steer Fred
         towards the righteous path by believing in him,

         possess a self-assurance, a stability and a faith in humanity which the bold idealists,
         the social climbers and the petty self-interests of Middlemarch lack. In the stormy
         seas of melodrama the viewer needs these small

         but bright beacons of light by which to navigate.</p>

      <p id="comment-275">275. <b>Commentary 36: Scene 6/4</b></p>




      <p>Scene 6/4 is short but impactful, beginning Episode 6 with the same tone that Episode
         5 ended in. The scene depicts yet another skirmish between Rosamond and Lydgate as
         she endeavours to conceal their financial struggles

         from the Middlemarch community and minimise her own hardship by deliberately ignoring
         or obstructing her husband’s decisions. In this instance, Rosamond excitedly gives
         Lydgate a letter from his uncle Godwin, who she has

         contacted in secret, seeking financial support. Far from receiving the positive outcome
         she anticipated, however, Godwin’s response rebukes Tertius for apparently asking
         his wife to write on his behalf. This is, Godwin writes

         sternly, a ‘roundabout wheedling sort of thing which I should not have credited you
         with’ and he observes perhaps more fairly that Tertius has evidently ‘made a mess’
         to request such assistance (Ch.65, p.200).</p>




      <p>In both the novel and the adaptation, Godwin’s letter arrives shortly after Lydgate
         realises Rosamond has instructed Trumbull not to readvertise the house for sale after
         the Plymdales take another property. These are

         unacceptable actions for Lydgate because — the narrator explains — while he is ‘prepared
         to be indulgent towards feminine weakness’, he cannot tolerate ‘feminine dictation’:
         ‘The shallowness of a waternixie's soul may have

         a charm until she becomes didactic’ (Ch.64, p.177). The sequencing of events thus
         serves to compound Lydgate’s anger and lead him to the realisation at the end of Chapter
         65 that he has been ‘mastered’ (p.205) by his wife.</p>




      <p>Although Davies’ adaptation cannot deliver so easily or explicitly a moment of anagnorisis
         for Lydgate, the scene has a similar function that is created in part, by mirroring
         the sequencing of events in the novel: Episode 5

         ends with the Plymdale conversation and Episode 6 begins immediately with the letter.
         This is a change from the Shooting script which opens instead with overlapping scenes
         of Lydgate working in the hospital (SS 6/1) and gossip

         and jokes about his debt at a soiree at the Vincy house (SS 6/2). Of course, these
         scenes also function to emasculate Lydgate, who Davies describes in attendance at
         the party looking ‘pale, drawn, at odds with the world’ and then

         later, ‘almost desperate’ (SS 6/2). But in excising 6/1-6/2 and opening with a scene
         that clearly continues the dynamic of 5/43, Davies gets us to same point in arguably
         a more economical fashion.</p>




      <p>Condensation occurs not only on a structural level, however. Lydgate is more direct,
         succinct and convinced of his position in the Post-production script than in the Shooting
         script where he asks, for instance, ‘Am I such an

         unreasonable, furious brute? Why should you not be open with me?’ (6/4). He qualifies
         similarly in the Shooting script, ‘I should never have been angry with you if you
         had been open with me’ (6/4). Greater concision in the

         Post-production script also diminishes the emphasis on the upsetting quality of Lydgate’s
         words. Rosamond’s complaint that Lydgate has not made her ‘life pleasant of late’
         is lost as is her husband’s subsequent reaction (‘LYDGATE

         can’t help wincing at that…. it’s so mild, so understated, compared to what he said’
         (SS 6/4)).</p>




      <p>Our overriding impression of the exchange is thus one of mutual distress. Despite
         Davies’ note that Rosamond looks ‘so meek, so victimised’ that Lydgate feels ‘a wavering,
         a hopeless tenderness’ (PP 6/4), we are not necessarily

         more sympathetic to either character. With his flushed and sweaty expression, Douglas
         Hodge’s Lydgate has an explosive fury. He stamps his foot to emphasise his exclamation
         of ‘for God’s sake!’ and the scene cuts to Trevyn McDowell’s

         Rosamond who bursts promptly into surprised tears. McDowell’s wet sobs and quick,
         high inhales of breath are quite a departure from either the ‘quiet passivity’ (Ch.65,
         p.201) and ‘coolness’ (Ch.65, p.203) or the gentle weeping the

         novel describes. Davies’ repeated stage direction that Rosamond ‘genuinely feels ill
         used’ (PP 6/4) also lends a sincerity to her final, shocking outburst that she wishes
         she had ‘died with the baby’ (PP 6/4). Eliot’s narration is

         not necessarily sceptical of this claim, but our feelings towards Rosamond are perhaps
         complicated by the unique insights the novel provides into her ‘quiet elusive obstinacy’
         (Ch.64, p.194). As the narrator observes sardonically,

         ‘there was but one person in Rosamond’s world whom she did not regard as blameworthy,
         and that was the graceful creature with blond plaits and with little hands crossed
         before her’ (Ch.65, p.202). Davies is typically kinder on Rosamond

         than Eliot, therefore and in this scene, her underhandedness is further mitigated
         by her husband’s failure to address the crisis. It is striking that in a condensed
         version of the scene in the novel, Davies maintains Lydgate’s admission

         that he had ‘nearly resolved on going to Quallingham’, but decided it was apparently
         no ‘use’ (PP 6/4); Lydgate wants to be the man of the house but he is reluctant to
         act.</p>




      <p>A final contributing effect on the scene’s adaptation from the novel comes not from
         Davies’ screenplay or indeed, Hodge’s and McDowell’s excellent performances but from
         the soundtrack and its (re)use of the cor anglais. Composer Chris

         Gunning – who used the woodwind instrument to great effect to accompany Dorothea and
         Casaubon on screen – returns to it again for the scene’s ending because of its ‘wonderfully
         sonorous, sombre sound’(Gunning 1993, p.7). One can identify,

         for instance, both a musical and a thematic kinship between this scene and Casaubon’s
         impossible request in 3/79. In both scenes, the cor anglais moves through arpeggio-like
         rising phrases against thrumming, unsettling strings. But the

         score’s minor key and the instrument’s tonal quality lends its progression from the
         mellow, lower notes of its register to the clearer, higher notes, a consistently plaintive
         quality that cleverly complicates the optimistic tug of the

         sequence’s upward trajectory. What begins in Episode 1 as distinct musical themes
         for each couple thus merges in tone and effect to the point where we hear in 6/4 a
         deliberate echo of a previous emotional stalemate. Rosamond’s and Lydgate’s

         desperate embrace echoes the fate of another couple doomed by their irreconcilable
         differences: Dorothea and Casaubon.</p>

      <p>In the BBC adaptation, Caleb Garth is the only character to whom John Raffles relates
         the story of Bulstrode’s disreputable past. It is supposed, of course, that Raffles
         is also drunkenly indiscrete in every local tavern he

         frequents, thus feeding the Middlemarch rumour-mill (as Bambridge boasts in scenes
         6/37-6/78). But it is, significantly, Caleb Garth in whom Raffles confides on his
         return to Middlemarch, when Garth finds him incapable at the roadside

         on the way to Stone Court. It is also important that Garth, the man of honour, does
         not disclose what he learns from Raffles, even though it is enough for him to refuse
         to work for Bulstrode forthwith.</p>




      <p>Thus, Garth occupies a position as Bulstrode’s conscience. From high tragedy through
         to popular melodrama, the embodiment of conscience is a powerful device. Garth will
         neither publish what he knows, nor even tell Bulstrode:

         ‘What he has said to me will never pass from my lips, unless something now unknown
         forces it from me’ (Ch.69, p.249). Moreover, in the adaptation it is not revealed
         to the viewer either. In the novel, Raffles has already reminded

         Bulstrode of his historic iniquities (Ch.53) and later revealed them to Will Ladislaw
         (Ch.60). The adaptation simplifies and concentrates this subplot in the malevolent
         presence of Raffles, and the principled conscience of Garth.

         For Davies, the details of Bulstrode’s crimes are less important than the effect of
         their disclosure which is, paradoxically, amplified by remaining obscure. The case
         against Bulstrode is not proven by evidence in court; he is tried

         by rumour in public. What Carolyn Steedman says of Lydgate is as true of Bulstrode:
         ‘Middlemarch <em>gets</em> him’ (2001, p.537).</p>




      <p>Garth is, by chance, Bulstrode’s inconvenient witness to Raffles’ first arrival in
         Chapter 53. They are on Stone Court land, laying plans for its management following
         Bulstrode’s purchase from Joshua Rigg. It is Garth who first

         spots Raffles: ‘Bless my heart! what's this fellow in black coming along the lane?
         He's like one of those men one sees about after the races’ (Ch.53, p.380). Once met,
         Garth quickly assesses the awkwardness of the situation and

         takes his leave, for ‘if there was anything discreditable to be found out concerning
         another man, Caleb preferred not to know it’ (p.381). This first encounter is reproduced
         in scene 4/50(b) of the Post-production script.</p>




      <p>It is also by chance that Garth later discovers Raffles on his final return and delivers
         him to Stone Court in his gig, thus affording the opportunity for Raffles to tell
         the story we never learn. Yet this episode is another example

         of an encounter that is dramatized on screen (scene 6/14) but merely reported (by
         Garth to Bulstrode) in the novel. Davies conveys the mounting sense of the past catching
         up with Bulstrode through a sequence of short scenes which

         segue into one another, depicting Garth’s discovery of Raffles (6/14), his delivery
         to Bulstrode at Stone Court (6/15a), Garth’s resignation (6/15b) and Lydgate’s attendance
         on the bed-ridden Raffles (6/17). This narrative compression

         adds pace and tension to Bulstrode’s downfall (via Raffles’ demise). This was aided
         in the final production by the removal of the unnecessary scene (6/16) showing Lydgate
         riding to Stone Court.

         </p>




      <p>In the novel Bulstrode is not at Stone Court when Raffles is delivered. Rather, in
         Chapter 69 Garth calls on Bulstrode at the bank and tells him what has happened, advising
         a doctor should be summoned. As usual, Andrew Davies draws

         effectively on the essential dialogue from the novel for scene 6/15b, but the linking
         scene which precedes it (6/15a) is an invention. By dividing scene 6/15 in two, Davies
         effects a structural improvement which separates Garth’s delivery

         of Raffles to Mrs Abel in the hallway and thence up to bed, Garth’s insistence that
         a doctor should be called and Bulstrode’s request that he summon Dr Lydgate, from
         Garth’s resignation (which takes place in the privacy of the parlour),

         leaving Bulstrode to contemplate his predicament.</p>




      <p>The altercation between the two men is a supreme example of dramatic contrast. Clive
         Russell’s Garth is upright, plain-speaking and honest: (‘I believe he told the truth,
         Mr. Bulstrode. And I can't be happy in working with you or

         profiting by you any more. It hurts my mind’, (PP, p.6/20)). This is matched by Peter
         Jeffrey’s puritanical Bulstrode, whose financial and evangelical domination of the
         community is now threatened by the desertion of loyal servants. When

         Garth assures him, ‘No need to repeat it. I'll never talk of it with anyone else.
         It's not for me to make your life any harder than it is’, Bulstrode responds in ‘genuine
         anguish’: ‘But you do make it harder, by turning your back on me’.

         Garth’s reply is couched in another phrase of disarming vernacular: ‘I have that feeling
         inside me that I can't go on working with you’. Bulstrode’s despair turns to anger.
         If he has lost Garth he must vouchsafe his silence (which has

         already been pledged): ‘I must have your solemn assurance that you will not repeat
         these ... slanderous allegations to any living soul!’ His ‘imperious manner’ riles
         the humble Garth to retort: ‘Why should I have said it if I didn't mean

         it? I'm not in any fear of you’ (PP, p.6/21). With that he leaves.</p>




      <p>In the power relations between them the tables are turned. Having removed himself
         from the moral burden of Bulstrode’s corrupted employment, Garth is free. His silence
         is a matter of his own honour, not something to be extorted by Bulstrode’s

         social superiority. Although this action holds a powerful emotional charge in the
         adaptation, and is a significant turning point in Bulstrode’s rapid downfall, George
         Eliot informs her readers of what is at stake. In the novel, it is Garth

         himself who has had the idea that the management of Stone Court might be an apprenticeship
         opportunity for Fred Vincy, enabling his marriage to Mary (Ch.68, pp.240-244). Bulstrode
         has approved this. Yet with his painful knowledge of

         Bulstrode’s past, the honourable Garth is unable to put his own family interests above
         a matter of conscience. This stands in plain distinction to Bulstrode’s false piety;
         for the novel tells us that Garth never ‘chose to be absolute except

         on some one else's behalf’ (Ch.56, p.46). In this way, he is the only character to
         stand up for Raffles (excepting Lydgate’s professional services).</p>




      <p>In the novel’s stark division between characters who act out of self-interest and
         those few who demonstrate altruism, Garth and Farebrother thus stand above even Dorothea
         (whose burden of inheritance is slow to be divested upon Farebrother,

         Lydgate and, ultimately, given up for Ladislaw). But Farebrother putting Fred’s feelings
         for Mary before his own, is as nothing to Garth’s sacrifice. And, indeed, Farebrother
         is not a man without his faults. By contrast, in a novel where few

         characters escape personal criticism, as Nicole M. Coonradt reminds us, ‘the narrator
         never presents Garth in an unfavourable light’ (2012, p.19).</p>

      <p id="comment-285">285. <b>Commentary 38: Scenes 6/36-6/38</b></p>




      <p>Andrew Davies establishes the morning of Raffles’ death scene quite beautifully in
         the Shooting script in 6/33 which doesn’t appear in the Post-production script. And
         the mise-en-scène he describes is realised only minimally in the scene as

         shot. Perhaps the symbolism would have appeared too obvious on screen: ‘On the table
         by the bed, the brandy bottle, three quarters empty, a little glass, a spoon, the
         opium phial…. It's like a genre painting. The little room. The morning light

         streaming in. The still life on the table’ (SS, p.6/51). What remains is the morning
         light, embalming the unconscious Raffles and washing away the night’s dark subterfuge
         under the clinical examination of the doctor.</p>




      <p>When Lydgate arrives to attend the last moments of Raffles’ life the narration in
         the novel and scripted stage directions make for an interesting comparison. In Chapter
         70 Eliot writes:

         'Lydgate arrived at half-past ten, in time to witness the final pause of the breath.

         When he entered the room Bulstrode observed a sudden expression in his face,

         which was not so much surprise as <em>a recognition that he had not judged correctly</em>.

         He stood by the bed in silence for some time, with his eyes turned on the dying

         man, but with <em>that subdued activity of expression which showed that he was</em>

         <em>carrying on an inward debate</em>' (p.273, emphasis added).</p>




      <p>Lydgate’s reaction to Raffles’ deteriorated condition is spelt out quite explicitly
         by Andrew Davies: ‘LYDGATE is thinking it's very strange, but doesn't feel he can
         ask further. BULSTRODE knows that he won't. The £1000 is not altogether

         irrelevant in this prolonged silence.’</p>




      <p>Actually, Lydgate does ask ‘further’ in Davies’ script than he does in Eliot’s novel.
         When Bulstrode explains that Mrs Abel had been left to tend to the patient the previous
         night (which is taken verbatim from the novel), Davies’ Lydgate

         responds with a new question: ‘And she understood the dosage?’ (SS, p.6/54). In this
         way, Douglas Hodge’s Lydgate is not quite as reticent as Eliot’s of whom we’re told:
         ‘he hardly knew how to put a question on the subject to Bulstrode without

         appearing to insult him; and if he examined the housekeeper—why, the man was dead’
         (Ch.70, p.274). Davies’ additional question places the blame more firmly on Bulstrode’s
         actions and less upon the possibility of his own misjudgement. Eliot’s

         Lydgate is less inclined to make a fuss about a man who is already dead and therefore
         shares more of Bulstrode’s moral culpability for the death. However, Douglas Hodge
         scarcely looks at Peter Jeffrey when he asks the question; had he done so,

         he would have seen the guilt in Bulstrode’s face.</p>




      <p>Lydgate’s contested part in the death of Raffles is also at the centre of the differences
         between the Shooting script and the Post-production script in the Middlemarch scenes
         which follow. First, is the exchange between Hopkins, the undertaker

         and Bambridge in the street, in which the latter ascertains that Raffles is dead and
         Bulstrode has paid for the funeral. In the novel Hopkins is a draper by trade who
         also ‘furnishes funerals’. Secondly, Bambridge’s swift calculations (‘Raffles

         and Bulstrode’), take the viewer into the next scene where he is seated opposite Hawley
         in the Green Dragon, presided over by Mrs Dollop and the cantankerous Hiram Ford.
         Much of Bambridge’s recounting of what Raffles had told him about his past

         dealings with Bulstrode, and Hawley’s extemporising upon this theme with his fellow
         lawyer Standish in the short scene which follows (6/39a), is cut from the final production.
         In 6/38 Bambridge has this: ‘The fact of it is, from what poor Raffles

         told me, if everybody got their deserts, Bulstrode would be saying his prayers in
         Botany Bay. Guilty secrets, crimes in the past. Raffles told me that he could tap
         Bulstrode to any amount. And now he's dead’ (SS, p.6/57). Only the last two short


         phrases make the final cut. Then thirdly, in 6/39a, Hawley has two speeches for Standish
         in the ‘Main Street’. In the first he says of Raffles: ‘Man's a rascal, of course,
         but I believed him. Seems our friend Bulstrode has a criminal past, and

         this man Raffles knew about it and was making Bulstrode pay for his silence.’ In the
         second he adds: ‘Apparently he made his fortune by buying and selling stolen goods...
         the man Raffles was in the same game. He threatened to tell the world, and

         now he's dead. It all looks very bad for Bulstrode’ (SS, p.6/59). Fourthly, back in
         the Market Square (6/39b), Lydgate walks past groups of gossipers and we catch the
         doctors Chichley and Wrench sharing the news. The latter concludes, ‘Too proud, the


         pair of them. And of course neither of 'em was from these parts. Foreigners, really,
         the pair of 'em’ (SS, p.6/60). Finally, the Shooting script returns us to the Green
         Dragon (6/41) where Crabbe (the glazier) and Dille (the barber – it’s Dill in the


         novel) converse with Hiram Ford and Mrs Dollop: ‘Doctor Lydgate, well known for cutting
         up folk before the breath is well out of their body ...’ (SS, p.6/61).</p>




      <p>One can see here what Andrew Davies is trying to do, and much of this gossip - spreading
         like wildfire through Middlemarch – is taken from the novel (Chapter 71). It demonstrates
         the local appetite for revenge upon Bulstrode and Lydgate and

         attributes this across the social strata. This quality of the animated populous is
         an aspect of the novel which is largely sacrificed in the adaptation. It is an ensemble
         effect which is difficult to achieve in character-centred television drama

         beyond the genre of soap opera in which character hierarchies are differently organised.
         In the novel it relies upon the effective marshalling of an omniscient narrator. Although
         Chapter 71 begins (like scene 6/37) with Bambridge and Hopkins,

         Hawley is swiftly apprised of the news and becomes the self-appointed investigator
         whose inquiries into the case take him as far as Farebrother at Lowick (who knows
         about Ladislaw’s mother) and Caleb Garth whose honourable reticence is so mangled


         in the rumour-mill ‘that even a diligent historian might have concluded Caleb to be
         the chief publisher of Bulstrode’s misdemeanours’ (p.284). Hawley’s investigations
         culminate in his hijacking of the Town Hall meeting originally convened to

         discuss an outbreak of cholera in Middlemarch (SS 6/43).

         </p>




      <p>The challenge for the screen adaptor at this point in the narrative is that the reader
         of the novel has already been apprised of all the facts of Bulstrode’s chequered history
         and knows the process of their revelation, and can thus recognise

         how community gossip manipulates and circulates stories. Because Davies had chosen
         early on not to include much of Bulstrode’s backstory, the dramatisation trades solely
         in rumour. The viewer knows that Bulstrode’s past has caught up with him

         (via Raffles) and this is enough to ruin his reputation and force his departure. The
         details are immaterial. In fact, rumour needs few facts to empower it and, in the
         final production, the circulation of the news of Raffles’ death and Bulstrode

         and Lydgate’s supposed culpability is much compressed into the scene in the Green
         Dragon (6/38) even if that necessitates the incongruous presence of Hawley sharing
         a pint with Bambridge. Mrs Dollop is given most of the lines condemning Lydgate’s


         unethical practices. This economy works up to a point to bring the drama to boiling
         point at the Town Hall meeting. But there Hawley’s odd summation leaves for the viewer
         some unaccountable details hanging in the air: ‘I don't maintain thieves

         and <em>cheat offspring of their inheritance</em> in order to set myself up as a saintly kill-joy!’ (SS, p.6/66). In an otherwise neat
         job of giving Bulstrode just enough rope to hang himself, this is the one loose end.</p>




      <hr>






      <p id="comment-290">290. <b>Commentary 39: Scene 6/61</b></p>




      <p>The context for scene 6/61, where Dorothea tries to persuade Lydgate that he should
         remain in Middlemarch and they momentarily come close to understanding one another,
         is altered slightly but significantly between Davies’ Shooting script and the

         Post-production script. In the final production scene 6/56b, where Ladislaw steps
         down from the stagecoach and re-enters Middlemarch life, is repositioned to immediately
         precede 6/61. This juxtaposes his return with the Dorothea-Lydgate scene and

         reminds the viewer of Ladislaw’s former resolve in her presence: ‘I was dreaming that
         I might come back some day. I don't think I ever will now.’ (SS 5/31). Ladislaw’s
         return to the town thus comes as a surprise to viewers as Davies has chosen to

         omit the novel’s details of his continued correspondence with the Lydgates which recently
         announced his intention to return to Middlemarch as ‘a very pleasant necessity’ (Ch.75,
         p.379). His arrival by stagecoach also replaces 6/60, a more pedestrian

         establishing scene in which Dorothea watches as Lydgate approaches Lowick on horseback.
         Instead, in the Shooting script, scene 6/57, where Rosamond first tells Lydgate that
         their party invitations have all been declined and then reveals that she has

         heard all of the scandal linking her husband to Bulstrode, directly precedes Lydgate’s
         visit to Lowick. This reversal of 6/56b and 6/57 in the chronology places the dramatic
         buffer of Ladislaw’s arrival between this heated conversation of the Lydgates’

         and the frank dialogue between Dorothea and the doctor.</p>




      <p>Scene 6/61 is a long scene in the Shooting script, reflecting a lengthy dialogue in
         Chapter 77 (pp.353-66). It is partly this that leads to it being split in the Post-production
         script between scene 6/61, which takes place in the drawing room at

         Lowick, and 6/61a which occurs outdoors in its front courtyard. When the scene opens
         in the final production, Dorothea is in a most confident stance: one hand resting
         on the mantelpiece, the other on her hip. Indeed, she is wearing the same black,

         rather magisterial, silk dress as in SS, 6/46 where she endeavours to persuade Chettam,
         Farebrother and Brooke of Lydgate’s innocence and where Davies’ stage direction encourages
         the production not to ‘be afraid of Georges de la Tour type lighting:

         three men of the world being inspired by a latter day St. Theresa’ (SS, p.6/71). She
         looks resolved to effect a plan as she addresses the rather cowed Lydgate who stands
         behind the sofa on the opposite side of the room. Although Lydgate has the first

         speech, explaining how he is being judged in Middlemarch, she is intent on seizing
         the initiative in order to help him.</p>




      <p>Nevertheless, as Davies’ annotations to the Shooting script show, he was wary of Dorothea
         coming across as ‘too self-centred’ and ‘self-pitying’ in some of the lines he takes
         straight from the novel. So he removes her sentiments that ‘to love what

         is great, and to try and reach it, and yet to fail’ causes only sorrow and, instead,
         Juliet Aubrey imbues eloquently the lines that are left - ‘You meant to lead a higher
         life than the common, and to find better ways’ (SS, p.6/86) - with sorrow and

         empathy. This is strong evidence that Davies knows when less is more. Susie Conklin
         confirms this when she recalls, ‘he was very good at knowing what was just too wordy…’,
         and ‘had a very good instinct… about making sure something has a dramatic background


         to it and not overloading it or being so precious about the book that you have something
         that doesn't come alive (Conklin 2022, pp.5-6).</p>




      <p>Davies proceeds by selecting the most telling lines from the novel and sometimes splitting
         dialogue to give particular lines more impact, as Dorothea strives to convince Lydgate
         that he can overcome this humiliation and still achieve ground-breaking work

         at the hospital. Hence her second speech begins with a line previously embedded in
         her first in the Shooting script: ‘I cannot rest in this as unchangeable’, lending
         it more emphasis (PP 6/59).</p>




      <p>The characters perhaps come closest when Lydgate shares the burden of his marriage
         with Dorothea: ‘you know what sort of bond marriage is’ he croaks out (PP 6/60). In
         the novel he prefaces this with ‘Why should I not tell you…?’ signalling that what


         follows will be something unusual for a man to share in confidence with a woman, let
         alone a client. Dorothea’s reaction also indicates shock and that she is unsure of
         how to respond: ‘Had he such sorrow too? But she feared to say a word’ (Ch.77, p.357).
         Unlike

         Eliot, in the 1990s Davies has no need to fear breaking such a taboo and accordingly
         when Douglas Hodge delivers the line about the marriage bond Aubrey steadily returns
         his gaze with no sense of shock. She will also go on in scene 6/77 to repeat almost


         verbatim Lydgate’s sentiments, that ‘marriage is so unlike anything else’ when counselling
         Rosamond (SS, p.6/108).</p>




      <p>In contrast to his note of caution about self-pity in Dorothea’s opening speeches,
         Davies seems intent on preserving every drop of Lydgate’s self-loathing and defeatism
         from the novel. This is epitomised in the doctor’s resolution to retreat to a practice


         in London: ‘That's the sort of shell I must creep in and try and keep my soul alive.’
         Although deriving this line directly from the novel, the stage direction which follows
         it (‘His aristocratic lip might curl a bit at the thought’ (SS, p.6/88)) illustrates


         Davies’ understanding of the bitterness this experience engenders in Lydgate. Brian
         Tufano’s lingering close-ups on the beleaguered Lydgate as he completes each speech
         track Hodge’s restless pacing around when he delivers his most bitterly self-hating
         lines.</p>




      <p>Dorothea is still operating in a different social sphere, hoping that she can use
         her money to support the hospital and make Lydgate’s life ‘whole and well again’.
         He kindly but pointedly remarks that she has ‘the goodness as well as the money to
         do all this’

         (SS, p.6/66) but that now he needs to ‘please the world and make money’ (SS, p.6/68).
         ‘Making your knowledge useful’ (PP, p.6/60), as she desires him to do, is now a redundant
         occupation to him. Distanced from the town and protected by privilege, Dorothea

         cannot understand that ‘knowing there were friends who would believe in you’ (PP 6/60)
         would not convince the ostracised Rosamond in Middlemarch.</p>




      <p>Scene 6/61 in the Post-production script ends with Dorothea’s pledge to visit Rosamond.
         This resolve enables the discussion between her and Lydgate in the new 6/61a to proceed
         more philosophically and to contrast what Eliot’s contemporary, philosopher

         Henry Sidgwick, described as ‘the point of view of the individual seeking his own
         happiness’ with ‘the point of view of the universe’ (Sidgwick 1874, 186 and 417).
         Once in the courtyard at Lowick, walking him to the stables, Dorothea seems to accept
         that for now

         she must let things lie, after Lydgate rejects her repeated claim that he has ‘achieved
         much in Middlemarch’ (PP, p.6/62). Now outside, Dorothea shares how in the early morning
         she communes with the natural world (anticipating the diaphanous dawn in scene 6/72).


         Davies then takes an adaptive diversion, appropriating Eliot’s metaphor of the ‘roar…
         on the other side of silence’ from Chapter 20 of the novel. Davies’ Dorothea channels
         Eliot’s narrator, commenting on the intense disappointment of the newly-married Dorothea


         in Rome, for this much later scene in the adaptation. Davies also alters ‘Eliot’s’
         ‘roar’ to a ‘muffled cry’ thus compressing the sense of the extended metaphor in the
         novel where Eliot refers to humanity being mercifully ‘well wadded with stupidity’
         (Ch.20, p.298)

         and so both unaware of the ‘roar’ and protected from the pain it would cause. Douglas
         Hodge, as Lydgate, listens to this outpouring but looks ahead, neither making eye
         contact nor expressing any distinct emotion. There is a sense in Page’s direction
         that the focus

         has shifted from individual suffering to the suffering of humankind. Hence Lydgate
         is side-lined dramatically as Aubrey delivers one of the novel’s most significant
         lines. Lydgate and Dorothea walk on and out of the frame and the scene ends. The reiteration
         of her

         promise to visit Mrs Lydgate that appears in the Post-production script is most likely
         an error in the editing of the broadcast version of the script.</p>




      <p>Scene 6/61a also offers a proleptic line from Dorothea, in which Davies anticipates
         Eliot’s summation of her protagonist’s life achievements in the novel’s Finale, when
         Dorothea enquires of Lydgate:</p>


      <p>'… humankind does advance by small steps, as well as great ones. Does it not? I must
         believe that, or it would break my heart.' (SS 6/88)</p>


      <p>to which, in his bruised state, he can only respond: ‘Perhaps’.</p>

      <p id="comment-295">295. <b>Commentary 40: Scenes 6/71-2 and 6/77</b></p>




      <p>The sequence that begins in 6/71, through 6/72a and into 6/77, takes place the morning
         after Dorothea catches Ladislaw and Rosamond in what she thinks is a romantic embrace.
         It prompts her to what she fears is a belated realisation — ‘Oh, I

         did love him!’ — and Dorothea spends the night in desperate ‘anguish’, her ‘grand
         woman’s frame’ shaken ‘by sobs as if she had been a despairing child’ (Ch.80, p.388).
         Not for the first time in the series, Dorothea thus spends a dark night of

         the soul in her bedroom before venturing out into Lowick’s grounds the following morning,
         still clad in her nightclothes. One might contrast 6/71, for instance, with the quiet
         resolution she reaches on the morning of Casaubon’s death when she

         greets him in the garden (‘Edward? I am come. I am ready’ PP, 3/84).</p>




      <p>Davies’ adaptation of these emotional reckonings echoes Eliot’s accounts in the novel.
         ‘It was not in Dorothea’s nature’, we are told, ‘to sit in the narrow cell of her
         calamity’ for longer than ‘the duration of a paroxysm’ (Ch.80, p.390).

         Instead, the following morning, Dorothea forces herself to attend once more to Rosamond
         and Lydgate’s troubled marriage. She decides that her ‘own irremediable grief [….]
         should make her more helpful, instead of driving her back from effort’

         (Ch.80, p.391). But while Eliot’s narrator has the privilege of sitting — both literally
         and figuratively — with Dorothea as she looks calmly ‘into the eyes of sorrow’ (Ch.80,
         p.390), the television series is challenged to express some of

         this resolution without a confiding narrator or the interpretive framework that Davies’
         stage directions provide when reading from the script.</p>




      <p>It does this in large part by reifying a brief but significant part of Dorothea’s
         cogitation. In the novel, Dorothea’s reflections take place entirely in the great
         chair by her bedroom window. As dawn breaks, she opens her curtains and looks

         out of the window to see ‘a man with a bundle on his back and a woman carrying her
         baby; in the field she could see figures moving —perhaps the shepherd with his dog’
         (Ch.80, p.392). For Dorothea these figures represent palpably, ‘the largeness

         of the world and the manifold wakings of men to labour and endurance’ (Ch.80, p.392).
         They are a reality from which she can neither ‘look out on’ from ‘luxurious shelter’
         nor ‘hide her eyes in selfish complaining’ (Ch.80, p.392) and thus checked,

         Dorothea determines to make her ‘second attempt to see and save Rosamond’ (Ch.80,
         p.394).</p>




      <p>As previously mentioned, the television series resituates Dorothea for the equivalent
         moment. 6/71 begins with Dorothea walking towards the camera as she leaves the house.
         Once in the grounds, the camera angle reverses so that we share her perspective

         as she watches a man and woman walk from left to right across the frame. The couple
         move briskly and with purpose. They are evidently itinerant farm workers as she carries
         a baby swaddled to her chest and he, a hoe, and a large bundle of goods.

         But at this point we see another difference from the novel: the man greets Dorothea
         and comments ‘Looks like a fine one [day]’ (PP 6/72a).  The camera cuts to a medium
         close-up of her face in response and Dorothea answers, ‘Yes. Yes, it does’, with a


         half-smile (PP 6/72a). We cut once more to the couple as they exit the frame and then
         back to Dorothea again, who watches their passage pensively.</p>




      <p>The Post-production script’s account of the meeting is less prescriptive than the
         Shooting script which notes that on their way, ‘the MAN stops, and takes the baby
         from the WOMAN, she takes his arm, and they walk on together’ (SS 6/72). It is not
         hard

         to imagine the emotional resonance of this version of the scene for Dorothea who watches,
         moved by a couple united in their purpose. As Davies notes on both scripts, in Dorothea’s
         ‘lightheaded state, it feels like an omen, a blessing’ (6/72a). In the

         finished scene, however, the couple simply walk past so that their fleeting presence
         has a similar but slightly more ambiguous effect on Dorothea. Before the scene ends,
         Davies’ prediction is realised regardless. A medium close-up of Dorothea’s face in


         pensive reflection dissolves and we return to the same shot of Aubrey’s body from
         behind, her body silhouetted against the brightening morning light.</p>




      <p>Indeed, the scene’s visual echo of the poor family Dorothea and Celia ride past in
         1/5 lends it a cautiously optimistic, and contemplative tone as the correspondence
         between the images invites us to reflect on the journey that Dorothea has made. In
         1/5,

         the similar sight of an itinerant labouring family reduced Dorothea to 'distressed'
         tears (PP 1/5) but here, it only seems to settle her resolve. A further interesting
         contrast is offered by a scene in the Shooting script which didn’t make the final
         cut

         but nevertheless illuminates Davies’ adaptation of Dorothea’s character. In 1/79,
         Dorothea exits a Roman church she has just visited and happily describes to her new
         husband the space within: ‘DOROTHEA [inspired]: It’s not as I would have – but I think
         I

         liked it, it was so very… calm. And [smiling] the Christ-child was so very like a
         real baby!’ Davies notes that there is ‘a bit of biology operating there, not just
         art-appreciation' (SS 1/79). Though we do not see Dorothea looking at the realistic
         depiction

         of Christ, her delivery is meant to reflect a young woman starting to yearn to be
         not just a wife, but a mother. Of course, Casaubon ‘barely manages a twitch of the
         lips’ in response and the scholar observes sourly instead that the church is ‘not
         amongst

         the artist’s finest work’ (SS 1/79). Like the other scenes set in Rome, 1/79 hammers
         home the fundamental mismatch between the couple. Dorothea’s flourishing maternal
         ambitions are thwarted by Casaubon’s disinterest in anything beyond his notes and
         his

         insistence that he is old before his time.</p>




      <p>Back in Episode 6, however, another dissolve moves us to the next scene (6/77) and
         into the interior space of Rosamond’s drawing room, where she and Dorothea sit directly
         opposite one another and within the same frame. The nature of this transition,

         with its momentary superimposition of Dorothea deep in thought and the two women sat
         intimately together, signals a relationship between the two scenes beyond their chronological
         placement. Unlike the novel, however, quite what links the scenes is not

         immediately apparent and it is worth pausing here to observe that this sequencing
         emerges from later drafts of the screenplay. In the Shooting script, Dorothea’s morning
         vigil cuts instead to Bulstrode who, Davies informs us, ‘might have been up all night


         as well’ (6/74). It is two scenes and an establishing exterior shot later that Dorothea
         then visits Rosamond in 6/77.</p>




      <p>Whatever the reason for their excision at this point in the episode, the reordering
         of scenes 6/74 and 6/75 allows Dorothea’s dawn encounter to imbue her subsequent meeting
         with Rosamond in a way that the novel itself invites. For instance, Chapter 81’s

         epigraph is taken from Goethe’s Faust and its description of one’s stirring sense
         of resolution amidst nature’s beauty echoes Dorothea’s realisation upon looking out
         on Lowick’s grounds and the ‘fields beyond’ (Ch.80, p.392). Certainly, when Dorothea
         speaks

         to Rosamond it is with the deliberateness that characterises her aforementioned announcement
         to Casaubon in 3/84; of a woman resolved to an unhappy fate. Aubrey’s slow, breathy
         delivery does not perhaps quite evoke the novel’s description of a ‘low cry from

         some suffering creature in the darkness’, but her increasingly wide and glassy eyes
         communicate the same point that she is clearly ‘speaking from out the heart of her
         own trial’ (Ch.81, p.402) when she imagines marriage as a murder that ‘stays with
         us [….]

         when everything else is gone’ (PP 6/77). And from there, the scene moves rapidly to
         its conclusion. Whereas the novel lingers on Dorothea’s efforts to vindicate Lydgate,
         the chief purpose of 6/77 is clearly to advance the Ladislaw plotline so that, having


         found some measure of equilibrium that morning, Dorothea is cast once more into a
         ‘tumult’ (Ch.81, p.407). The scene thus concludes with a tight close-up of Aubrey’s
         face, her eyes searching and her eyebrows quirking hopefully upwards at the last moment
         to

         a gently stirring soundtrack of violins and harp.</p>




      <p>6/77 is not only significant because of its furtherance of the Dorothea-Ladislaw romance,
         however. Like its novel equivalent, the scene represents a key unifying moment between
         two central narratives which have hitherto run in parallel. Labouring under

         the apprehension that Rosamond is about to embark on an affair with Ladislaw which
         will doom her relationship with Lydgate, Dorothea delivers a heartfelt appeal that
         connects their experience of the ‘awful [….] nearness’ of marriage (PP 6/77). As Davies
         notes,

         ‘She [Dorothea] is thinking about her failed marriage with Casaubon, of course’ (PP
         6/77). But even if Rosamond exonerates herself from this charge, Dorothea’s words
         have a clear impact. Rosamond’s continued resistance to Lydgate’s authority has in
         its own

         way indelibly shaped her relationship, just as in Dorothea’s chiasmic wisdom an imagined
         infidelity ‘murders’ marriage but damns the marriage to ‘stays with us like a murder’
         (Ch.81, p.405).</p>




      <p>This is a challenging sequence for both performers but perhaps more so for McDowell
         as Rosamond, who must move from being ‘a bit overcome and a bit overawed’ by Dorothea’s
         kindness; distressed to hear that Lydgate cares for her happiness ‘more […] than

         anything else’ (‘ROSAMOND starts to cry’); cognisant of the echo of her own failing
         marriage in Dorothea’s account; and lastly, eager to reassure the other woman (‘You
         are thinking what is not true’ (PP 6/77). Davies’ stage descriptions offer relatively


         limited notes for Rosamond at this crucial but complex moment, illustrating Gary Cassidy
         and Simone Knox’s observation that understanding ‘what actors do when they act, cannot
         be made more easily manageable through reference to other objects such as scripts,


         especially when those themselves are far from fixed’ (2015). One must turn instead
         to the nuances of McDowell’s performance, in which project we are aided by Middlemarch’s
         seriality. John Caughie muses that ‘[r]epetition – the fact that television is there,


         week in, week out, and actors appear repeatedly in different roles and with different
         functions – means that the television actor is more likely to carry a history with
         him’ (2000, p.149). For Caughie, repetition occurs on a macro scale across an actor’s


         career, but his point is applicable within the smaller and shorter repetitions of
         a series like Middlemarch too. By the final episode of the series, we, the audience,
         are already well acquainted with McDowell’s incarnation of Rosamond.</p>




      <p>It is this knowledge which works with McDowell’s performance to convey the scene’s
         complicated emotionality, but which also indicates to us that we are witnessing something
         new from her character. Rosamond’s sobs are interrupted by a look of increasing

         intensity as she realises that Dorothea has the wrong end of the stick. McDowell delivers
         Rosamond’s assurances with red, tearful eyes but there is a selfless determination
         to her words that we have yet to see on screen. Although the two women have hardly


         met before, they are clearly united at this point by their shared experience of the
         solitude of marriage; through her empathy, Dorothea cultivates an understanding with
         Rosamond that contrasts starkly against the little other female friendship she has
         (the

         competitive intimacy Rosamond once shared with Mary Garth, for instance). Unlike previous,
         similarly tearful moments in the series, this is not a skirmish to be won, but a rare
         moment for Rosamond — like Dorothea — to step outside of herself and act on an

         impulse to comfort ‘which she had not known before’ (Ch.81, p.406).</p>

      <p id="comment-300">300. <b>Commentary 41: Scenes 6/85-91</b></p>




      <p>When the interview with Andrew Davies for the BBC Education film ‘Screening <em>Middlemarch</em>’ was recorded, in Autumn 1993, the screenwriter wass not certain how his adaptation
         would end. ‘Did you think about actually having George Eliot in it?’, the interviewer


         asked:</p>




      <p>I wanted to keep her out of it so far as possible because she writes

         such a wonderful story I wanted it to tell itself. But then right at the

         end I thought … it’s important about what happens to the characters

         after the end of the story because this isn't one of those stories that

         ends and so they lived happily ever after; they live fairly happily and

         some of them not very happily at all, and I thought whose voice can

         say this? – not one of the characters. So George Eliot's voice speaks it

         and at the moment when I'm talking to you I don't know what's going

         to be on the screen when George Eliot's voiceover is spoken about

         what happened to Lydgate, what happened to the Bulstrodes, what

         happened to the Garths, what happened to Fred and Mary and all

         those people, what happened to Dorothea. It's still up in the air. I'd

         like it to be sort of flashbacks of those characters, but by the time

         this is filmed we'll know what the answer is (Davies 1993, p.93).</p>




      <p>Carolyn Steedman reminds us that George Eliot herself was still uncertain as to the
         ending of her story when Book I was already in print (Steedman 2001, p.107). Elsewhere
         in her stimulating collection of essays entitled Dust, she contrasts the contemporaneous


         rise of historical and biographical writing: history, she asserts, can never be about
         ends, only endings (2001, p.150). George Eliot’s historian-narrator of <em>Middlemarch</em> also plays upon this distinction. The unresolvedness of <em>Middlemarch</em>’s Finale, and its

         narrator’s self-conscious staging of these loose ends, is one of the qualities of
         the book which anticipates narration in twentieth-century fiction as well as looking
         back to the novel’s speculative origins in the hands of Sterne and Fielding. Another,
         as

         Steedman also shows us, is the narrator’s suggestion that ‘no-one wrote this book
         nor told this story at all’ (2001, p.108). This denial of authorship may be divined
         from the town’s speculation about the reported publications of Fred and Mary Vincy
         which

         concluded that, ‘there was no need to praise anybody for writing a book, since it
         was always done by somebody else’ (Finale, p.456). Nicole M. Coonradt reads this playful
         conceit as an ‘ironic commentary on the author's own early career in publishing before


         the public knew who "George Eliot" was’, and when assumptions were made that George
         Henry Lewes must be behind it (2012, p.26). This aligns with Coonradt’s committed
         argument that Mary Garth is the closest to being the novelist’s alter ego in her fictional


         world. Indeed, ‘in all of Eliot's novels there is only one female author: Mary Garth’
         (2012, p.17). But Steedman’s point goes beyond matters of authorship and autobiography;
         it is about the Finale’s insistence upon the contingency of the fictional world:

         ‘Every limit is a beginning as well as an ending’ (p.455).</p>




      <p>It is perhaps fitting that an adaptation which began so radically differently from
         the novel’s Prelude on Saint Theresa (and its ‘Fugue’ for Miss Brooke), should at
         its conclusion defer to the narrative voice which has been suppressed or diffused
         through

         much of the intervening drama. Yet film drama can accommodate non-realist framing
         devices most effectively in its beginnings (with title credits overlaying scenic exposition)
         and endings (as here with summary voice-over montage). Indeed, the viewers of television


         drama serials are quite used to summary montage sequences reprising key events (‘Previously…’)
         from the second episode onwards. What Andrew Davies imagined for the end of his Shooting
         script was a sort of cameo carousel (not dissimilar to the novel’s own Finale).

         Following Dorothea and Will’s passionate resolution (6/84), this sequence charts Dorothea’s
         breaking the news to Celia (6/85) at the end of which the narrative V/O begins; the
         Lydgates’ departure from Middlemarch (6/86-89) ending in a freeze-frame of the couple


         in a stagecoach in the market square; ‘Fred and Mary on the church steps on their
         wedding day’ (6/90) at Lowick (freeze-frame as wedding photo), and finally (6/91),
         ‘Dorothea and Ladislaw working in their library together… A small child sits playing
         on the rug’

         (p.6/124). The last shot is ‘Dorothea's lovely face fades to black’.</p>




      <p>In the novel, Dorothea’s visit to Celia comes at the end of a lengthy family counsel
         chez ‘Tipton and Freshitt’ which mainly demonstrates Chettam’s resolute refusal to
         accept Dorothea’s alliance with Ladislaw (Ch.84). This is followed (Ch.85) by the
         Bulstrodes’

         ignominious departure (leavened only by their decision to reinstate the Garths’ management
         plan for Stone Court, enabling Fred and Mary to marry). Chapter 86 sees Caleb Garth
         setting out this arrangement to Mary, and then to Fred. These events have already
         been

         covered in the adaptation in the short scenes 6/74 and 6/75. The novel’s Finale then
         sequences the narrative future’s marital carousel thus: Fred and Mary, the Lydgates,
         Dorothea and Will.</p>




      <p>Andrew Davies successfully fillets Eliot’s Finale for seven short speeches in the
         Shooting script across the scenes outlined above. In fact, the Post-production script
         allows for some expansion of these extracts into five substantive speeches. But the
         key difference

         between the Shooting script and the final production is not what is spoken by the
         narrator but the replacement of new scenes ending in freeze-frames with a montage
         sequence of flashbacks. The Production schedule confirms that none of the new scenes
         (6/86-91) was staged.

         From the testimony of Director Anthony Page this was likely because of time constraints
         rather than cost savings: ‘Time was… the worst constraint… and in fact… some scenes
         were dumped because there wasn't time to finish them or, to do them. So I would say
         the budget

         was very… generous and the schedule was, as is usual, rather tight’ (1993, pp.21-2).
         Thus a decision was made to use flashbacks and construct the ending in the edit suite.
         Davies would have known this at the time of his BBC Education interview, though he
         clearly did not

         know which scenes had been chosen.</p>




      <p>What difference does this make? It creates a dissonance between the voice-over narration
         which reveals aspects of the characters’ future lives and the visuals which replay
         only moments we have already seen. This tension, which traps the characters visually
         within the

         dramatic world as screened and consigns their futures to the viewer’s own imagination,
         could be interpreted as a disservice to the novel’s concern for the future: ‘For the
         fragment of a life, however typical, is not the sample of an even web’ (Finale, p.455).
         Flashbacks,

         when they are dissociated in montage from the psychological perspectives of specific
         characters, are redundant signifiers.  At best, they suggest that these characters
         cannot inhabit the futures that the narrator predicts for them but are forever caught
         in this uneven web

         of drama (i.e. ‘Previously…’). The promise of progress is denied them. First, we see
         Rosamond and Lydgate in their early days of married bliss (from scene 3/53); second,
         there is the happy ending to the orchard scene where Mary kisses the dumbfounded Fred
         (5/46); finally,

         Dorothea comes from the Lowick library, crosses the hallway and climbs the heavy wooden
         staircase, as if still in Casaubon’s shadow. This sense of referring back to their
         past lives, not their futures, is reinforced by the last shot in the Post-production
         script: ‘[Mix to

         countryside - shepherd and sheep. Carriage enters frame L - credits roll]… [Credits
         roll over carriage moving L to R into the distance and shepherd and sheep going R
         and out of frame L…]’ (pp.6/82-3). The inference is that Lydgate, the newcomer to
         Middlemarch with his

         innovative ideas and arrogance of the youthful professional, has been humbled and
         expelled from the provincial town. Rather than the upbeat musical theme that heralded
         Lydgate’s arrival, the ‘Middlemarch’ melody accompanies his inferred departure. We
         are back where we

         started.</p>




      <p>Of the three ‘flashbacks’ that make up the final scene, however, Dorothea’s needs
         qualifying. Its identification as a ‘flashback’ in the Post-production script signals
         its probable existence in an earlier edit, but for the audience at least, this is
         brand new footage. The

         fact of its reuse is further concealed by a lack of dialogue in Dorothea’s scene or
         indeed, any identifying noises other than the click of her shoes. Similarly, there
         is little else to place this moment temporally, even if we can locate it geographically.
         By comparison, the

         two couples’ original dialogue clearly continues underneath Dench’s voiceover and
         Gunning’s score, further adding to the disjointedness of this moment. There is no
         fooling the audience that these moments are unique.</p>




      <p>As a result of this subtle difference, Dorothea’s described future feels perhaps less
         constrained to, or defined by her fellow protagonists. There is also more obvious
         visual correspondence between Eliot’s narration and the sequence playing on screen.
         Dorothea’s slow,

         solitary progress up the stairs, accompanied by the books cradled to her chest, becomes
         a neat visual shorthand for her hard-won knowledge and liberty; she had, the narrator
         tells us, ‘no dreams of being praised above other women’ but ‘the effect of her being
         on those around

         her was incalculable’ (PP 6/85). By choosing not to iterate Dorothea’s kiss with Ladislaw
         as her final scene, and to place her in a context where she is reflective, having
         learnt she could if she needed to exist alone, also appears to put a modern 1990s
         veneer on the ending.</p>




      <p>Yet, this footage has in a sense been reused because — like the two other flashbacks
         — it expresses something apparently integral or representative about Dorothea. There
         is a familiarity to the image of Dorothea moving through the darkness of Lowick, attending
         to Casaubon's

         business, that allows it to function within the edit as a kind of intellectual rather
         than literal flashback. But it is Casaubon’s ghost that haunts these moments. One
         might reflect, for instance, on an inverted version of this sequence in 3/67 when
         Casaubon travels up the stairs

         to meet an expectant Dorothea. Certainly, there remains a forbidding quality to Lowick
         that the narration does not quite dispel. Dorothea looks contemplative and not unhappy,
         but she remains a solitary figure; her isolation only sharpened by her distance from
         the camera’s static

         position on the ground floor. The light pouring through the windows, meanwhile, does
         nothing to brighten the darkness of the house. It catches upon Dorothea’s pale face
         and neck, and on her cream shawl but, facing away from us, Aubrey’s dark head is easily
         lost amidst the shadows.

         It thus feels a particular unkindness that the voiceover is timed to end at the point
         when Dorothea is furthest from the camera and thus deepest in the house; Lowick, it
         implies inaccurately, will remain Dorothea’s ‘unvisited tomb’ (PP 6/85).</p>




      <p>It may be useful here to reflect on Steedman’s identification of Eliot’s narrative
         world, where ‘Destiny stands by sarcastic with our dramatis personae folded in her
         hand’ (Ch.11, p.142). For Steedman, ‘Eliot makes Destiny a woman, with a sarcastic
         attitude’ (2001, p.107). It must

         be remembered that in 1994 the much respected but widely eclectic Judi Dench had yet
         to be adorned with the mantel of ‘national treasure’. She was more familiar to British
         television audiences at the time for the bitter-sweet sit-coms <em>A Fine Romance</em> (LWT, 1981-84)

         and <em>As Time Goes By</em> (BBC, Series 1, 1992). It is perhaps difficult now to dissociate the magisterial
         benevolence of her disembodied incarnation of ‘George Eliot’ from her later roles
         (as Queens Victoria, Elizabeth I, and Bond’s ‘M’). And the simplicity with which

         the adaptation assumes, unproblematically, that <em>Middlemarch</em>’s narrator is George Eliot herself, and makes Destiny’s hand her own.</p>
