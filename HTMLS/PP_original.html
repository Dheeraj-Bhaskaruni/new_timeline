         <p id="excitement-over-plans">LYDGATE is really excited by the architect's drawings,

            <br>Mmm, this is an excellent design, Mr.
            Bulstrode. The architect has vision and,
            and he's been well instructed.
             [he looks inspired]
            <br>You know in a few years time we could
            have a first class medical school here in
            Middlemarch - why should London and
            Paris and Edinburgh have it all? I am
            convinced that the causes and treatment of
            typhoid and cholera will very soon yield to
            rigorous scientific investigation - and why
            should they not yield to it here, in
            Middlemarch? Where are the kitchens?
            Ah yes. I see. Good. Good.</blockquote>

            good here. My aim is to do good small work

         <p>It's clearly a point of great moment for BULSTRODE.
            LYDGATE feels awkward. He likes Farebrother, feels
            he'd like to oppose BULSTRODE, but recognises that he
            doesn't know the pros and cons of the situation.</p>

            see what DOROTHEA sees in him. A man lit by inner
            fires, with a formidable intellect and a great soul.</p>

            my good and learned friend the Reverend
            Edward Casaubon, and to share their

            reaching out, an exploration, if you will,

            fellow-men at heart, and women, too, of

            Doctor Lydgate, who studied in Paris and

         <p>Bells, lots of them, the distant ones discordant, as

         <p>CASAUBON in his big hat and huge black coat looks
            more like death than ever. He's doing his duty
            as a husband, escorting his wife, looking straight ahead,
            as one setting out on a testing hike. DOROTHEA eager
            to drink in all the sights and sounds, but perhaps already
            worried about whether he's happy.</p>

         <p>We are close in on them nearly all the time - but this is
            the square in which their apartment is, we'll see it again.
            And they do attract curious glances wherever they go, the
            strange English couple.</p>

      <p>MIDDLEMARCH - RECAP</p>


      <p>Comprised of 4 clips from Episode 1.</p>


      <p>Clip 1. LYDGATE MEETING ROSAMOND AT STONE
         COURT FOR THE FIRST TIME</p>


      <p>LYDGATE
         How do you do Mrs Vincy. I heard
         Miss Vincy was a musician. I confess
         I hadn't expected that she would be quite
         so talented.</p>


      <p>FEATHERSTONE
         Best In Middlemarch, I'll be bound.</p>


      <p>Clip 2. MARY AND FRED AT STONE COURT</p>


      <p>FRED
         If you won't give me any encouragement
         I shall just get worse.</p>


      <p>MARY
         I won't give you any encouragement. It
         would be a disgrace if I accepted a man
         who got into debt and wouldn't work.</p>


      <p>Clip 3. CASAUBON AND DOROTHEA ON ROME STEPS</p>


      <p>DOROTHEA
         I would love to visit the antiquities of
         course but only if you enjoy it too. I
         would be far happier if you would let me
         help you with your research for the book.</p>


      <p>Clip 4. LADISLAW SEES DOROTHEA IN THE MUSEUM</p>


      <p>LADISLAW
         I don't know what I should do. I'm not so
         brazen as ..you.</p>

            always does when he's unsure of himself, but

         <p>NAUMANN is a successful painter. He is working on
            on more than one unfinished painting, and finished ones
            are hanging all over the place. Large scale stuff ...
            Romantic, symbolic, full of heroic-figures.</p>

         <p>CASAUBON looks as if he's ready to leave, but
            NAUMANN seizes the moment.</p>

               of its leading minds. They are looking at the "Keepsake",
               which has pictures of famous society beauties in it.</p>

            <p>NED has a Middlemarch accent of the genteeler sort. His
               family are on the up-and-up financially while the Vincy
               fortunes are declining. But he feels much less secure

         LYDGATE TALKS TO DOROTHEA ABOUT
         CASAUBON</p>


      <p>LYDGATE
         It is essential now that he should not strain
         his nervous powers in anyway. In
         particular, I would advise you not to tell
         him of the seriousness of his condition.</p>


      <p>Clip 2. EXT. LOWICK GROUNDS
         DOROTHEA WALKS WITH BROOKE IN THE
         GROUNDS OF LOWICK.</p>


      <p>DOROTHEA
         Uncle, I don't think that Mr Ladislaw
         should come to Middlemarch at all.</p>


      <p>LYDGATE
         Whatever you say my dear .... who are we
         to forbid him if he really wants to come?</p>


      <p>Clip 3. INT. STONE COURT
         MARY TALKS TO FRED.</p>


      <p>MARY
         Every chance you get you waste how could
         I respect you and how could I marry a man
         I can't respect?</p>


      <p>Clip 4. INT. VINCY'S
         LYDGATE PROPOSES TO ROSAMOND</p>

         <p>LADISLAW sees CASAUBON. He's glad to have

         <p>He pauses for a moment, little smile, then strides on.</p>

         <p>CASAUBON doesn't see LADISLAW. He's immersed,
            as usual, in his own preoccupations.</p>

            Does he really mean to stand for

            <br>He brings it upon himself. He's the worst
            landlord in the county. I do think one is
            bound to do the best one can for one's land
            and tenants, especially in these hard times.
            I want him to take Caleb Garth on again as
            his agent - he got rid of Garth twelve
            years ago, and everything's been going
            wrong since. I think of getting Garth to
            manage for me - he's an excellent man.</blockquote>

      <div>
         <p>The market square is full of PEOPLE, some going about
            their business, some gathered in knots and talking
            eagerly, even quarrelling.</p>

         <p id="tonks-sparks">We hear in the distance TONKS, an political agitator,
            talking to a group of townsfolk. It is difficult to make out
            what he saying - his words become clearer as we near him.</p>

         <p>Nearby a man is putting up pro-reform posters.</p>

            workers like yourself being denied a voice
            in parliament! What we need, friends,
            what we need, is the vote so that we can
            put, so that we can put a man in parliament
            who will speak for us!</blockquote>

         <p>And he strides, on his way to the Pioneer office, while
            we get closer to TONKS, the agitator, who has got his own
            little circle, and a loose-knit audience.</p>

         <p>HAWLEY, WRENCH and one or two other gents

            from the silk-weaving factories and workshops and the
            garment trade ...</p>

            faced grinning man, the VENT we'll call him, in the

      <p>MIDDLEMARCH - RECAP</p>


      <p>Comprised of 6 clips from Episode 4.</p>


      <p>Clip 1: EXT/INT. LOWICK.
         Establisher and Interior of Library with Brooke
         and Chettam.</p>


      <p>CHETTAM
         ....to make a will like that, coupling her
         name with this man Ladislaw. What a
         damned insult to Dorothea.</p>


      <p>Clip 2: EXT. FRESHITT GROUNDS.
         Celia and Dorothea.</p>


      <p>CELIA
         He has made a codicil to his will - to say
         the property is all to go away from you if
         you were to marry Mr Ladislaw.</p>


      <p>Clip 3: EXT. LOWICK.
         Ladislaw strides away from Lowick.</p>


      <p>LADISLAW V/O
         Then you approve of my going away for
         years and never coming back again until
         I've made my mark in the world.</p>


      <p>Clip 4:INT. STONE COURT
         Raffles/Bulstrode</p>


      <p>RAFFLES
         Two hundred. How's that for a bargain.
         Give me two hundred and I'll go away.
         I'll pick up my portmanteau at the
         turnpike and then off like a bullet.</p>

         horse. Captain Lydgate tries to steady it.</p>


      <p>Clip 6:INT. LYDGATES
         Lydgate sits next to Rosamond's bed.</p>


      <p>ROSAMOND
         Tertius. Oh don't be angry with me?
         Tertius are you? Are you angry with me?</p>

            You see she has set her mind against my
            being a clergyman, and I don't know what
            to do unless I can get at her feeling. I
            would like to learn farming, but that takes
            capital, and Father can't spare any more
            and he says there's no more room for me in

            Ned Plymdale is going to be married to
            Miss Sophie Toller. I'm sure they'd be
            glad to take this place with most of the

            <br>They must put up with what they can get.
            They have been looking at a house next to
            Mr. Hackbutt's in St. Peter's Place. It is
            near the church, and a genteel situation.
            But the windows are very narrow ... you
            wouldn't happen to know of any other
            house that might be at liberty now or in the

            <br>You had reason enough? To contradict my

            spoke just as violently as you did just now.
            But that doesn't alter my opinion that you
            ought to try every other means rather than
            take a step which is so painful to me, and
            so degrading to you.</blockquote>

            <br>Oh, you may do so, of course. You may
            do so. But I think you ought to have told
            me before we were married that you would
            place me in the very worst position, rather

            <br>When we were first married everyone felt
            your position would be very high. I could
            not have imagined then that you would like
            to sell our furniture. Take a house in
            Bridge Street, where the rooms are like
            cages. If we are to live in that way let us

      <p>RECAP</p>


      <p>Comprised of 5 clips from Episode 5.</p>


      <p>Clip 1. EXT. LOWICK - INT. FRESHITT.
         Dorothea tells the Chettams and
         Mrs Cadwallader what her plans are.</p>


      <p>DOROTHEA
         I've been thinking about what I
         could do with Lowick. I'm going to
         build a kind of colony there. Where
         everybody shall live and everybody shall
         work and the work should be done well.</p>


      <p>MRS CADWALLADER
         Well</p>


      <p>Clip 2. INT. SPOONER'S OFFICE
         Lydgate asks for further help with his debts.</p>


      <p>SPOONER
         Along with what you already owe this
         establishment, that would make £527
         altogether. Is that agreeable?</p>


      <p>LYDGATE
         I appreciate your understanding.</p>


      <p>Clip 3. INT. TIPTON
         Ladislaw says goodbye to Dorothea.</p>


      <p>LADISLAW
         What I care for more than I can ever care
         for anything else is absolutely forbidden
         me.</p>


      <p>DOROTHEA
         Please remember me?</p>

      <p>RECAP [CONTINUED]</p>


      <p>Clip 4. INT. STONE COURT BEDROOM.
         Bulstrode tries to frighten Raffles.</p>


      <p>BULSTRODE
         If you return to Middlemarch. If you use
         your tongue against me you will have to
         live on such fruits as your malice can bring
         you. Now, do as I order you or I shall send
         for the Constable to take you off my
         premises.</p>


      <p>Clip 5. INT. LYDGATE'S
         Rosamond and Lydgate argue.</p>


      <p>ROSAMOND
         I hate your stupid experiments. I hate
         them.</p>

      <div>
         <p>ROSAMOND, excited, walks into the study with a
            letter that has just arrived.</p>

         <p>LYDGATE is packing his doctor's bag.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote>
         <blockquote><u>ROSAMOND</u>
            <br>Tertius, here is a letter for you!</blockquote>
      </blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He takes it. Looks at the handwriting.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote>
         <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u> [surprised]
            <br>My Uncle Godwin!</blockquote>
      </blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>She sits down and waits eagerly while he opens it and
            starts to read. But it's obviously not what she hoped.
            LYDGATE's face is like thunder. She feels scared.</p>

         <p>He looks up from the letter as if he hates her.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote>
         <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
            <br>Rosamond: it will be impossible to live
            with you if you continue to deceive me.</blockquote>
      </blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>He reads from the letter, using the words like blows,
            aiming to hurt.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote>
         <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
            <br>"Dear Tertius: don't set your wife to write
            to me when you have anything to ask. It is
            a roundabout wheedling sort of thing which
            I should not have credited you. I never
            choose to write to a woman on matters of
            business. As to my supplying you with a
            thousand pounds, I can do nothing of the
            sort."</blockquote>

      <div>
         <p>He tosses the letter across the table to ROSAMOND.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote>
         <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
            <br>Read the rest yourself: it sticks in my
            throat.</blockquote>
      </blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>She reads it silently.</p>

         <p>There is something more savage boiling up inside
            LYDGATE. When she's finished, she lays the letter
            down, and sits quite still, "intrenching herself in quiet
            passivity against her husband's wrath".</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote>
         <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
            <br>Will this be enough to convince you of the
            harm you do with your secret meddling?</blockquote>
      </blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>She sits still, with lowered gaze. Her passivity enrages
            him. He stands.</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote>
         <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
            <br>I had nearly resolved on going to
            Quallingham myself. It would have cost
            me pain to do it, yet it might have been of
            some use. But it has never been of any use
            to me to think of anything - I'm at the
            mercy of your devices! If you mean to
            resist every wish I express, for God's sake
            say so and defy me! I shall at least know
            what I am doing then!</blockquote>
      </blockquote>


      <div>
         <p>Now she does look at him, and she looks so meek, so
            victimised that even now he feels a wavering, a hopeless
            tenderness ... she is, after all, as lovely as ever, and she
            looks so pitiable. She starts to cry.</p>

         <p>He speaks much more gently:</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote>
         <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
            <br>Oh, Rosy. Can't you see that nothing
            can be so fatal as a lack of openness, of
            confidence between us.</blockquote>

            mistaken, and that I may depend on your
            not acting secretly in future?</blockquote>
      </blockquote>


      <blockquote>
         <blockquote><u>ROSAMOND</u>
            <br>You expect me to make promises, when
            you have used such cruel words against me.
            I think you ought to apologise.</blockquote>

         <p>A little tremor at the end there, she genuinely feels ill­
            used.</p>

         <p>He looks at her. So lovely. Come on, one last big effort:</p>
      </div>


      <blockquote>
         <blockquote><u>LYDGATE</u>
            <br>You should allow for a man's words when
            he's disappointed and provoked. You and I
            can't have opposite interests.</blockquote>
      </blockquote>


      <blockquote>

         <p>Mildly spoken, but another crushing blow.</p>

         <p>BULSTRODE stares at him as one betrayed, picks up his
            hat, but has to grab at the edge of the table to save himself
            from falling. Clearly he can't walk unaided. But no one
            goes to his aid.</p>

         <p>LYDGATE, with a terrible sinking feeling of disaster,
            feels that he has to do it. It is, as Eliot says, like putting
            his sign-manual to the association.</p>

         <p>He helps BULSTRODE walk slowly out of the room,
            the CROWD shouts increase as they go.</p>

         <p>LYDGATE and BULSTRODE go through the door, and

               <br>All who have cared for Fred Vincy and
               Mary Garth will like to know that these two
               achieved a solid mutual happiness. Fred
               became rather distinguished as a farmer ­
               but was always prone to believe he could
               make money by the purchase of a horse
               which turned out badly. Though this Mary
               observed was of course the fault of the horse
               and not of Fred's judgement. They had three
               children, all boys, never became rich, but
               saved enough to become the full owners of
               Stone Court.</blockquote>

               <br>And Dorothea?
               She had no dreams of being praised above
               other women, feeling that there was always
               something better which she might have
               done, if she had only been better and
               known better. Her full nature spent itself
               in deeds which left no great name on the
               earth. But the effect of her being on those
               around her was incalculable; for the
               growing good of the world is partly
               dependent on unhistoric acts, and on all
               those Dorotheas who live faithfully their
               hidden lives, and rest in unvisited tombs.</blockquote>
